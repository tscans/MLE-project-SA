/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<hr>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.</p>
<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Instructions">&#182;</a></h2><p>Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '<strong>TODO</strong>' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a <code># TODO: ...</code> comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!</p>
<p>In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '<strong>Question:</strong>' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '<strong>Answer:</strong>' header by editing the Markdown cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> keyboard shortcut. In addition, a cell can be edited by typically clicking it (double-click for Markdown cells) or by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> while it is highlighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="General-Outline">General Outline<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Outline">&#182;</a></h2><p>Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download or otherwise retrieve the data.</li>
<li>Process / Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Upload the processed data to S3.</li>
<li>Train a chosen model.</li>
<li>Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).</li>
<li>Deploy the trained model.</li>
<li>Use the deployed model.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.</p>
<p>First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.</p>

<pre>Tweaked a little bit, &#39;Nothing&#39; could be a children&#39;s film. It&#39;s a very clever concept, touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes, and goes against pretty much every Hollywood convention you can think of...what goes against everything more than, literally, &#34;nothing&#34;? Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives. All that&#39;s left is what they don&#39;t hate, and a big empty white space. It&#39;s hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film, especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot. It focuses on pretty much one subject, but that&#39;s prime Vincenzo Natali territory. If you&#39;ve seen &#39;Cube&#39;, you know already that he tends to like that type of situation. The &#34;nothing&#34; in this movie is apparently infinite space, but Natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic, if only because there&#39;s literally nothing else, and nowhere else to go. The actors sell it, although you can tell these guys are friends anyway. Two actors from &#39;Cube&#39; return here (Worth and Kazan), but are entirely different characters. They change throughout the story, and while they&#39;re not the strongest actors in the world, they&#39;re at least believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I say this could be a children&#39;s film under the right tweaks, is because aside from a few f-bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence, the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids. So I find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore, especially considering there isn&#39;t very much of it. This could&#39;ve gotten a PG rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue. There is very little objectionable about this film, but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it. I only say that&#39;s a shame because not because I support censorship, but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this is a reasonably entertaining film, albeit with a few dragged-out scenes. But for literally being about nothing, and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing, they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film.

<pre>Tweaked a little bit, &#39;Nothing&#39; could be a children&#39;s film. It&#39;s a very clever concept, touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes, and goes against pretty much every Hollywood convention you can think of...what goes against everything more than, literally, &#34;nothing&#34;? Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives. All that&#39;s left is what they don&#39;t hate, and a big empty white space. It&#39;s hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film, especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot. It focuses on pretty much one subject, but that&#39;s prime Vincenzo Natali territory. If you&#39;ve seen &#39;Cube&#39;, you know already that he tends to like that type of situation. The &#34;nothing&#34; in this movie is apparently infinite space, but Natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic, if only because there&#39;s literally nothing else, and nowhere else to go. The actors sell it, although you can tell these guys are friends anyway. Two actors from &#39;Cube&#39; return here (Worth and Kazan), but are entirely different characters. They change throughout the story, and while they&#39;re not the strongest actors in the world, they&#39;re at least believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I say this could be a children&#39;s film under the right tweaks, is because aside from a few f-bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence, the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids. So I find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore, especially considering there isn&#39;t very much of it. This could&#39;ve gotten a PG rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue. There is very little objectionable about this film, but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it. I only say that&#39;s a shame because not because I support censorship, but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this is a reasonably entertaining film, albeit with a few dragged-out scenes. But for literally being about nothing, and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing, they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Above we mentioned that <code>review_to_words</code> method removes html formatting and allows us to tokenize the words found in a review, for example, converting <em>entertained</em> and <em>entertaining</em> into <em>entertain</em> so that they are treated as though they are the same word. What else, if anything, does this method do to the input?</p>

<p>The method below applies the <code>review_to_words</code> method to each of the reviews in the training and testing datasets. In addition it caches the results. This is because performing this processing step can take a long time. This way if you are unable to complete the notebook in the current session, you can come back without needing to process the data a second time.</p>

<h2 id="Transform-the-data">Transform the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Transform-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label <code>0</code>) and truncate long reviews.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">(TODO) Create a word dictionary<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">&#182;</a></h3><p>To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be <code>5000</code> but you may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODO:</strong> Complete the implementation for the <code>build_dict()</code> method below. Note that even though the vocab_size is set to <code>5000</code>, we only want to construct a mapping for the most frequently appearing <code>4998</code> words. This is because we want to reserve the special labels <code>0</code> for 'no word' and <code>1</code> for 'infrequent word'.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the cells above we use the <code>preprocess_data</code> and <code>convert_and_pad_data</code> methods to process both the training and testing set. Why or why not might this be a problem?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It's basically a speed/performance problem. With preprocess_data, the method is doing "heavy lifting" of file io. With convert_and_pad_data, we change it up and save in memory a new set of data.</p>

<p>The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.</p>
<p>First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.</p>

<p>Supposing we have the training method above, we will test that it is working by writing a bit of code in the notebook that executes our training method on the small sample training set that we loaded earlier. The reason for doing this in the notebook is so that we have an opportunity to fix any errors that arise early when they are easier to diagnose.</p>

<p>In order to construct a PyTorch model using SageMaker we must provide SageMaker with a training script. We may optionally include a directory which will be copied to the container and from which our training code will be run. When the training container is executed it will check the uploaded directory (if there is one) for a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and install any required Python libraries, after which the training script will be run.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Training-the-model">(TODO) Training the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Training-the-model">&#182;</a></h3><p>When a PyTorch model is constructed in SageMaker, an entry point must be specified. This is the Python file which will be executed when the model is trained. Inside of the <code>train</code> directory is a file called <code>train.py</code> which has been provided and which contains most of the necessary code to train our model. The only thing that is missing is the implementation of the <code>train()</code> method which you wrote earlier in this notebook.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Copy the <code>train()</code> method written above and paste it into the <code>train/train.py</code> file where required.</p>
<p>The way that SageMaker passes hyperparameters to the training script is by way of arguments. These arguments can then be parsed and used in the training script. To see how this is done take a look at the provided <code>train/train.py</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="Step-5:-Testing-the-model">Step 5: Testing the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-5:-Testing-the-model">&#182;</a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">Step 6: Deploy the model for testing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using <code>word_dict</code>. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.</p>
<p>There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called <code>model_fn()</code> and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the <code>model_fn()</code> method from the <code>train.py</code> file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> )</p>
<p>Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until <em>you</em> shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.</p>
<p>In other words <strong>If you are no longer using a deployed endpoint, shut it down!</strong></p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Deploy the trained model.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The accuracy of this model and the XGBoost model are pretty similar. I would imagine XGBoost would perform quicker. Given that XGBoost is trending towards being the best tool to use especially for AWS I would think it would be better for sentiment analysis at least on this platform.</p>

<p>The question we now need to answer is, how do we send this review to our model?</p>
<p>Recall in the first section of this notebook we did a bunch of data processing to the IMDb dataset. In particular, we did two specific things to the provided reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed any html tags and stemmed the input</li>
<li>Encoded the review as a sequence of integers using <code>word_dict</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In order process the review we will need to repeat these two steps.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Using the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> methods from section one, convert <code>test_review</code> into a numpy array <code>test_data</code> suitable to send to our model. Remember that our model expects input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code>.</p>

<p>As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.</p>
<p>We will store the code that we write in the <code>serve</code> directory. Provided in this directory is the <code>model.py</code> file that we used to construct our model, a <code>utils.py</code> file which contains the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and <code>predict.py</code>, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that <code>requirements.txt</code> is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.</p>
<p>When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_fn</code>: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.</li>
<li><code>input_fn</code>: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.</li>
<li><code>output_fn</code>: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.</li>
<li><code>predict_fn</code>: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the <code>input_fn</code> and <code>output_fn</code> methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.</p>
<h3 id="(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">(TODO) Writing inference code<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">&#182;</a></h3><p>Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.</p>

To begin with, we need to construct a new PyTorchModel object which points to the model artifacts created during training and also points to the inference code that we wish to use. Then we can call the deploy method to launch the deployment container.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The default behaviour for a deployed PyTorch model is to assume that any input passed to the predictor is a <code>numpy</code> array. In our case we want to send a string so we need to construct a simple wrapper around the <code>RealTimePredictor</code> class to accomodate simple strings. In a more complicated situation you may want to provide a serialization object, for example if you wanted to sent image data.</p>

b&#34;Why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down? It is cute and funny (exactly what it is meant to be). Madonna wasn&#39;t out to prove herself as an Oscar calliber artist with this movie anyhow! She was just doing what the character called for, and she did it well. I loved her in this movie; it is my second favorite Madonna movie after Evita. The soundtrack is excellent too. It is no better or no worse than any cheesy 80&#39;s flick. To all the critics, just don&#39;t take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it. Madonna is a goddess!!!&#34;
b&#39;This movie is excellent. Not because it does anything special or new, but because it is consistently great in all of its parts. No part stands out as being &#34;ground-breaking&#34; or &#34;stellar&#34;, but all parts are far above mediocre, and that makes, to me, an excellent movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own several copies of this movie, and may acquire it on collectors DVD or Blu-Ray, someday (holding off right now due to high blu-ray prices, and of course the face that I don\&#39;t have a blu-ray player... but that\&#39;s beside the point of this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stars off sort of ordinary, but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension, some action, strongly portrayed characters, and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait, no, it does NOT start out ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out sort of like what a Qun. Tar. movie WISHES it could be. With an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes... very, very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the movie, nothing was as it seemed, and a few people are dead, and a few people are very rich. I won\&#39;t tell you who... watch and enjoy! Overall rating: 10/10, A**, Excellent!&#39;
b&#34;This movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays ever written. It is well executed, acted and directed. The cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but I&#39;m sure it was intended to be so. The screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie, through out the movie I found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen. This is a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews. Fair warning though this was a 6 tissue movie for me. Very touching. Very Heartfelt performances.&#34;
b&#39;Ocean\&#39;s twelve is probably better than Ocean\&#39;s eleven. I know most people would disagree, But I actually liked it more. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. The reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict(Andy Garcia) in the last film. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. Ocean\&#39;s twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than Ocean\&#39;s eleven. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace saying &#34;I just walked in that new Dennis Quaid movie&#34; and other things. I think Ocean\&#39;s Twelve is probably the best in the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plot: A year or so after Ocean\&#39;s Twelve, Terry Benedict(the guy they robbed in the last film) is back and says that if Ocean\&#39;s eleven doesn\&#39;t pay him back the money they stole, he\&#39;s going to call the cops. So Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old cop girlfriend Isabelle. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them around. Also, the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With many funny scenes like when Tess(Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean\&#39;s Twelve is a pretty clever film. It\&#39;s cooler, funnier, and more entertaining than Ocean\&#39;s eleven.&#39;
b&#34;This film did a wonderful job of capturing NYC stereotypes at there best. If you want a simple, cute story however, you won&#39;t find it here. The related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close-knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is Manhattan. A perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at New York life in its most natural state.&#34;
b&#34;The directing is brilliant, the casting is remarkable (though I would&#39;ve loved to have seen a little more of Aaron Lustig (from Y &amp; R fame), who played Paul Shaffer). I only have two minor quips about the film, as subtle as they are. One- Roebuck&#39;s Leno is excellent, but his stage presence (i.e. during what appears the taping of one of his late show episodes) is a tad underwhelming. Two- the distribution of the foul language. I am willing to tolerate foul language, so long as it is not used gratuitously, and to a degree, the film was gratuitous. The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of Bates&#39; otherwise well-portrayed Kushnick by her frequent use of it, and served to make Roebuck&#39;s Leno a goody-goody by his lack of use of it (of course, if the characters really did behave this way, kudos to everybody). Nonetheless, the piece is an excellent one, as far as television and video are concerned. The film, I feel, had potential for the big screen, but would&#39;ve required re-casting for the bit parts, and probably a different director, as well (the aesthetic feel is that of the Larry Sanders show, good for HBO, mediocre for cinematic purposes).&#34;
b&#39;Plunkett and Macleane is a wonderful updating of the swashbuckling tradition, predating Johny Depp and his pirate friends. The tone is lighthearted, with a touch of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. One could almost see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out in low gear, with the introduction of the characters and the establishing of the themes of social inequality and rebellion; but, it kicks into high gear once the boys hit the highways. The robberies are grand and stylish, with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of swashbucklers. The actors are engaging and help elevate the material a bit, which is fairly hollow. There\&#39;s not much depth to the figures, but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesn\&#39;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muh has been said about the modern music. Period music tended to the more serene, which seems out of place. A classical score with Celtic rhythms for the action pieces could work, but the more modern, rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add an edge to the action. Since the characters are more legend than reality, accuracy in the music seems pointless. The pieces tend to fit the mood of the aired scenes, so it mostly works well. I just wonder how they missed Adam Ant\&#39;s &#34;Stand and Deliver.&#34; Make no mistake, this is not a serious film. It\&#39;s pure escapism and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott shows some of the visual flair of his father, but I don\&#39;t think we are going to see many Oscar nods in his career just yet. He seems to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film. With time he may prove to be a name to reckon with. His father took a while to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more rounded director. This is definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a swashbuckling film fest.&#39;
b&#39;Travis and Sandy(Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.)are horse traders coerced into selling their animals to a Mormon group and guiding them across the frontier to a settlement. What they do not expect is to encounter the notorious Clegg murderers, with their wounded leader Uncle Shiloh(Charles Kemper). Ward Bond portrays Elder Wiggs, the main voice for the Mormon group moving the wagon train to the Lord\&#39;s destination. Along the way, they also encounter &#34;Doctor&#34; A Locksley Hall and his &#34;Hoochey Koochey Wagon&#34; and lend them help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovingly directed by Ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail. The film has a wonderful cast made up of character actors with nary a true star in the film which is actually a blessing to see, if just not for a change of pace. Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. come off real well, but this is Bond\&#39;s film to shine as he has the best lines. Johnson is the one who seems to understand ruffians and brutes like Shiloh and will certainly come in handy when certain conflict might develop as the Clegg boys ride along side them a piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;d have to say this is one of his best and most least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well.&#39;
b&#39;Many Americans are lazy, and this has manifested itself even in our DVD-watching. Many of us don\&#39;t like to take the time to read an hour-and-a-half (or more) of subtitles, so we choose not to see many foreign films. One film that is TOTALLY worth your time, no matter how mundane a task you might think the subtitle-reading is, however, is &#34;The Green Butchers.&#34; It\&#39;s by far the best foreign film I\&#39;ve ever seen, and tops many American films I\&#39;ve seen lately as well. It\&#39;s a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue. The character depth derived in this film is AMAZING. The way Svend and Eigel (sorry if those are spelled wrong) feed off each other\&#39;s contrasting personas is downright spectacular! The actors were well-cast, and I\&#39;m very much hoping that a sequel is in consideration...it needs very little of Bjorne and what\&#39;s-her-face...just give me Svend and Eigel on some sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing dialogue! To the author of this fine screenplay, I say: Write more! The story itself is rather twisted, but you\&#39;ll find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyhow...with no remorse. PLEASE check this movie out!&#39;
b&#34;I just love this show.It&#39;s so funny and cool.Kuzco is such a hilarious and interesting character, I love him.He&#39;s the thing that makes this show what it is, although Kronk and Yzma are so funny and charming too.Everything about this show is great for me, because it always manages to make me laugh, no matter if it&#39;s only once an episode.It&#39;s just so funny and all the characters are so lovable and cool, it makes the show worth the time to watch, unlike some crap on Disney channel.Give this show a try next time it&#39;s on, if you&#39;ve seen the movie, and even if you haven&#39;t seen the movie, you&#39;ll find this to be very enjoyable anyway, so go ahead.&#34;
b&#39;As a fan of Wm. Faulkner since college, I was especially pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons. My grandfather, also named Clarence Brown as was the director, grew up in the Oxford area having been born near there in 1888. We attended a week long family reunion at Oxford in July, 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie. It still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of Ole Miss. My recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but I was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white. I was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go. Anyhow, the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and I would love to know more about that story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now days, Oxford is a larger, more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and I hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years. Juano Hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an Oscar that year but Hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen. Other Faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare. One of the best was a PBS treatment of The Barn Burner from about 1985 or so starring Tommy Lee Jones. It really captured the intensity of rural Southern whites that Faulkner wrote so incisively about so often.&#39;
b&#39;This movie caught me by surprise. For years I have avoided many of Harold Lloyd\&#39;s sound pictures (as well as those of Keaton) because they have a generally well-deserved reputation for being lousy compared to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost. However, when I saw this film I was pleasantly surprised to find I actually liked it,...once I accepted it really was not a &#34;Harold Lloyd&#34; film (despite him starring in it). This is because although it is nothing like the style of his earlier films, it IS highly original and Lloyd isn\&#39;t bad playing a totally different type of character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned above, the formula of the old films is almost completely missing here. Lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work, the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances, and the plot is just plain weird! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time since he was a small boy. Because of this, though he looks like an American (except for his white suit and explorer\&#39;s helmet), he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is Chinese. In many ways, he\&#39;s very naive about America and is like an innocent among wolves. Early on, he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss. This boss ALWAYS produces a losing candidate for the mayoral race--because he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a &#34;token&#34; candidate who has NO CHANCE of winning. Well, the old geezer who they traditionally run for office just died and he decides to run the naive Lloyd--he hasn\&#39;t a prayer of winning! Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins!!! This, and Lloyd\&#39;s decision to clean up the town greatly upsets the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy honest Lloyd. Just when it appears Lloyd is headed to jail on a trumped up corruption charge, he creates a scheme that is 100% impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from the crooks. However, despite this, it is incredibly funny and a great ending. So, my advice is at the end, just suspend disbelief and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important note: This movie is definitely NOT politically correct. The word &#34;Chink&#34; is used repeatedly. I found it offensive but considering the times, I ignored it as you should too. If, however, you are someone who CAN\&#39;T and like being angry, I suggest you never watch movies anyway--as you are bound to become offended again and again.&#39;
b&#39;The film tackles the here and now horror of &#34;rendition&#34; with a multi-cast trans-global account of all involved. No-one gets off lightly because we see the blindness of the players as they carve out their own slice of the worldwide game piling hatred and misery on their &#34;enemies&#34; and themselves in equal measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interplay between the sympathetic Senator\&#39;s Aide (played in scintillating style by Peter Sarsgaard) and the real Washington power-mongers is electrifying. Meanwhile out in the field, new CIA man (Jake Gyllenhaal) goes through a sea change in his attitude to the USA\&#39;s new found cosiness with torture. Sudden though his rejection of what he initially tacitly condoned is, one has to ask why on earth would anyone who calls him or herself civilized stand and watch anyone be humiliated and abused in this way? The film has few heroes - perhaps Gyllenhaal\&#39;s flawed and vacillating CIA man is the exception and a necessary indulgence to make the film offer a sliver of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad fact of course is that this film isn\&#39;t fiction at all, but a wake up call to those with a shred of decency left in them. The awful truth is that we in the UK and USA have lost the moral plot and this film shows how low we are prepared to go. All this in the name of freedom! There\&#39;s a wonderful line in the script that says that torture is a sure way to swell the numbers of our enemies. This is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this film delivers and start using our might and money much more intelligently!! The message seems to be that any of us who claim that rendition, torture and the abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are as wrong-headed and stultifyingly stupid as the Jihadists and suicide bombers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All praise to the sensibilities of a talented South African director with a eye on the gross unfairness of how power is exercised, and a cast of principled mainstream actors from the US and beyond. Oh, and by the way, the film has a sting in its tail with the ending a clever and thought provoking surprise (which I won\&#39;t give away).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the film in an early London preview so it has not yet been widely written up but I\&#39;m glad to say that the tide of less than glowing reviews seems to be turning. The BBC review has been very strongly in support and they (and I) suspect that much of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specs of Hollywood - where the good guys and the bad guys are cardboard cut-outs. Hence the reason that many of the truly great films of the year are increasingly indie and/or non-US pix.&#39;
b&#34;as a former TV editor, I can say this is as authentic as it gets. It even led to Letterman&#39;s producer (thought to be a source) resigning (eventually) in real life. Letterman was outraged (OK, so one goofy thing is it has him throwing softballs at a tire swing on his estate; total fabrication) but the main information is hilariously true, from the silly bidding war for Letterman once he decided to leave NBC to Leno&#39;s problems with an agent who was not ready for big time, but who he let run the show (almost to a disastrous exit) out of his famed loyalty. If any of you kids don&#39;t grasp the idea of why Letterman is jealous to this day, see this tape.&#34;
b&#39;as a \&#39;physically challenged\&#39; person (god, how i hate that phrase) i just happened to catch this on cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch - overall, it was a fantastic movie. yes, i was a little disappointed upon finding out that neither actor is disabled, and yes, i was a little disappointed that more of the movie wasn\&#39;t filmed from the \&#39;true\&#39; point of view of the disabled (can you imagine what it\&#39;s like always being the tallest person in the room and then having to live the rest of your life with a view of nothing but other people\&#39;s asses and crotches? having to always wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only handicapped stall, enduring everyone else\&#39;s rude bodily expulsions while you wait?). and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me! been there, done that, literally. but the movie was true enough to matter - while i\&#39;ve never lived in a home or assisted residence, there were plenty of times throughout the movie where i found myself nodding and saying to myself &#34;yeah, that\&#39;s true.... that\&#39;s happened to me....&#34; what impressed me is that some of the commentors on this board expressed the fact that the movie made them view life a little differently and with a little more insight as the lives of a silent \&#39;minority\&#39; - can\&#39;t ask more than that out of a movie, that it makes you think and view life differently, so by virtue of that alone, the movies was tremendously successful. should be required viewing of every kid in junior high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty much for every person that\&#39;s severely physically disabled, independence is one of, if not the most important focus of our daily lives, from working to socializing to recreating. for those of you who felt the movie was \&#39;cliched,\&#39; try living our life for a single day - you\&#39;ll see that the movie was \&#39;cliched\&#39; because..... it\&#39;s true. the challenges the actors faced only skimmed the surface of what happens to us every day - if we\&#39;re lucky, we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters (including the girl) did. every day presents obstacles for us to overcome - it\&#39;s just that there\&#39;s no swelling, dramatic music to accompany our lives, unless it\&#39;s in our ipods.... lol!&#39;
b&#39;First I have to admit that I have had some doubts about the director. He has done some movies (with Jarkovsky) about the recent &#34;czech=east&#34; history or more precisely about families (individuals) how did they survive some historical moments. But it was always like the chines food sour-sweet. This movie was totally different. It was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human natures. This film is an excellent piece of art (story, acting, picture, music) but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we don\&#39;t want to see. By the way I have saw it on a DVD (with English subtitles) but I am afraid that in the USA I wont be able to get it.&#39;
b&#39;Follow-up to 1965\&#39;s &#34;My Name Is Barbra&#34;, and shot in brilliant color, &#34;Color Me Barbra&#34; has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst, and beguiling seriousness for a crazy-quilt hour of show-biz razzle dazzle. She\&#39;s a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. With her Egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, she\&#39;s also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, even if a few of her songs are not (&#34;One Kiss&#34;, &#34;Yesterdays&#34;). The circus sequence isn\&#39;t as intriguing as the museum trip (with the conceit of Barbra becoming the images in the paintings, an idea which works better than you may think). The circus-medley (built around songs featuring the word &#34;face&#34;!) is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting. Still, this is a lively, jazzy special--not quite as emotionally tantalizing as &#34;My Name Is Barbra&#34;, but certainly a sterling sophomore effort.&#39;
b&#34;Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute&#39;s terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Ren\xc3\xa9e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman&#39;s authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.&#34;
b&#39;So when I first saw commercials for Greek I did have a few questions to how they were going to approach Greek life, if they were going to give away sacred frat and sorority secrets, if they were going to focus on the brother and sisterhood a fraternity or sorority brings, or what most college kids think of Greek life as a huge party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, it covered everything. The story plot was great, it gave you a character to love, hate, someone you want to be like, someone you don\&#39;t want to be like, and of course a crazy roommate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was one of my first looks at what writers believed Greek life to be like, and I can honestly say they hit the nail pretty dead on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how one of the biggest things they covered throughout the season was the relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate. Its hard enough moving away from home, and being forced to live in a small room with someone you don\&#39;t even know, then come to find out.. you have nothing in common. Probably every college bound freshmens worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rustys sister Casey was pretty much the typical girl on campus EVERYONE is jealous of. What didn\&#39;t she have? Oh thats right.. Evan all to herself. Rebecca and Evan had an &#34;affair&#34; early into the season, which made you feel fairly sympathetic for Casey. Her character evolved, and her relationship with Rusty became more and more loving and outgoing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cappie is one of the most fun loving characters, and absolutely insane. One of my favorite episodes included him getting completely trashed at a strip club, and Rusty having to call Casey to bail them out. I like how they addressed the issue of gay people in Greek houses, Calvin was a very real feeling character, and I really respected him because he stuck to his standards. So Jen K was fairly crazy, but she actually liked Rusty. It was surprising and I continued to question her from the start, but of course, I did want it to work out between her and Rusty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely looking forward to the return of Greek. It takes you into the truth of Greek life, something that a lot of people look past. One of the biggest things that frats and sororities are known for is parties and drinking. Greek is a great show, and the characters are easy to relate to.&#39;
b&#34;Some have commented on the subtitles not being a problem in this film - I beg to differ - the nuisances in the facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters is such that you can not afford to take your eyes away for even a fraction of a second. I tried to watch, on the DVD, in English to overcome this problem (don&#39;t make this mistake the result is a travesty). The only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession so you know it and then ignore the subtitles. An acting master class - not in the dialogue but body language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the little things - the postmaster/shop keeper puffs out his chest and goes in to get his cap before delivering a letter from !France!. The General&#39;s bemused expression as his delight in a bunch of perfect grapes elicits a biblical reference with a profundity worthy of &#39;Being There&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography is awesome and the bleak minimalist village with its washed out colour just accentuates the sumptuousness of the feast when it comes. I have a friend who claims to be descended from the Borgias and who&#39;s family motto is &#39;If it is worth doing, it is worth doing to excess&#39; - Amen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laugh out loud and cry each time I watch this film&#34;
b&#34;First of all - I&#39;m not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70&#39;s when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home. At the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own. I&#39;m not surprised the movie and Elton John&#39;s soundtrack are almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.&#34;
b&#39;Ernst Lubitsch gave us wonderful films like Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop around the Corner, To be or not to be, and other wonderful films. But People usually put Bluebeard\&#39;s eighth wife as one of Lubitsch\&#39;s weakest films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I consider this film as an important film. This film began the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for Ernst Lubitsch\&#39;s Ninotchka. Of Course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. After that, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. They together wrote the screenplay for famous films like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of funny moments in the film. I thought &#34;The Taming of the Shrew&#34; was very funny. There is a famous expression called &#34;Films are slices of Life.&#34; And Here is a great example from Bluebeard\&#39;s eighth wife (1938).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the first session of the scripting process, Lubitsch posed this question: how do the boy and girl get together? Billy Wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the men\&#39;s shop of a department store. &#34;The boy is trying to buy a pajama,&#34; he extemporized glibly. &#34;But he sleeps only in the tops. He is thrifty so he insists on buying only the tops. The clerk says he must buy the pants too. It looks like a catastrophe. Then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants.&#34; Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. It wasn\&#39;t till months later they discovered that Billy Wilder himself is a tops-only sleeper and that he had been nursing the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this information from a book. I think this film can be considered as the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Right after this film, he made wonderful films like Ninotchka, The Shop around the Corner, and To be or not to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought Gary Cooper\&#39;s performance was good. I think Lubitsch casted Gary Cooper probably because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Deeds who inherited the fortune in Frank Capra\&#39;s Mr. Deeds goes to town. But this is just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I highly enjoyed the film. I rate this film 9 out of 10. Lubitsch films are different, because his films are slices of life.&#39;
b&#34;I don&#39;t understand this movies distinctly average rating!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really really enjoyed it, i even stayed up till early morning to finish watching it on late night t.v&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three excellent characters here, excellent characters. Danny DeVito played a gem, quite a feat considering he was directing as well. His down trodden laughable at times character was brilliantly written and was surreal in a absolutely believable way. There ARE people like that, Owen was just on the line without crossing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy Crystal&#39;s comic syle and sense of timing was PERFECT for his role. His frustration/comedy was interesting and captivating and what&#39;s more... you could understand his feelings. To really feel like you know a character is hard to achieve from the writers point of view, to find the right actor to pull it off is an art in itself and both were achieved here thrice over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, who else could have played Momma? There is no one that can play this part so well. There is a style there unlike any other, something you love to watch, i found myself waiting for her to appear on screen... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because Momma&#39;s character was, again, so on the line without crossing it that it was excellent to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what&#39;s more? A happy ending with new found friendships, no one getting hurt and everyone getting what they wanted in life... WITHOUT a big hunk of cheese tied on the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great film.&#34;
b&#39;NOROI follows a documentary filmmaker, Masafumi Kobayashi, as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that\&#39;s leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake. After interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby\&#39;s cries coming from the house next door (where there is no baby), Kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor. He\&#39;s greeted with hostility by the unhinged, disheveled woman (Maria Takagi) who answers the door (and promptly slams it in his face) and gets a peek at her 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely, both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noises, as well as her daughter, are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that. This piques Kobayashi\&#39;s interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what\&#39;s going on. He soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister, unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic. Well-known 10-year-old clairvoyant, and TV celebrity, Kana (Rio Kanno) seems to think we may all be doomed, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help. Another female psychic/actress (Marika Matsumoto) becomes involved, as does Mr. Nori, a mentally unstable kook/psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to &#34;ectoplasmic worms.&#34; Clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that\&#39;s now covered by a lake, and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many other hand-held horror flicks, this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first-person scares. Thankfully there\&#39;s something of a storyline here, a very interesting and intricate one at that, so it doesn\&#39;t rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera-work every once in awhile to keep your interest. The way Masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth - with well placed jolts along the way - reminded me somewhat of THE OMEN in its pacing. The film also doesn\&#39;t entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian, but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we\&#39;re watching is an already completed documentary. That helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the \&#39;actual\&#39; footage either. Overall, it\&#39;s a well-made horror film, with lots of plot shifts, some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments, that\&#39;s well worth checking out. My only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long. Otherwise, pretty good stuff.&#39;
b&#39;\&#39;Identity\xc2\x96 . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separate from them and it\&#39;s being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what\&#39;s inside our identity is everything that\&#39;s ever happened to us\&#39; (Ntozake Shange qtd in &#34;Fires in the Mirror&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pieces like Decalogue V used to intimidate me. I felt that if I accepted them, than I would be compromising something. What I thought before really isn\&#39;t worth getting into. I understand what Naturalism is trying to say. I experienced a tangible katharsis, and one that fell into existence piecemeal, and one that\&#39;s still alive, that I still have to reckon with. It\&#39;s still working inside me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film wasn\&#39;t sympathetic, per se. It doesn\&#39;t need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing. There are certainly wicked people; whether or not they should die is for another film. What Decalogue shows is that good, beautiful people exists who kill other people when their society and primal urges jack them up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \&#39;science\&#39; of naturalism is what has helped me to appreciate Decalogue V. It\&#39;s not worth the writing space to go into why I would not let myself before, but I see now the worth in making art like this to \&#39;make\&#39; people, or perhaps to make people do something. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s a method to Lazar\&#39;s compromise of his . . . light. Much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect. This should not be too strange of an idea: after all, how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect. I wince when I say it, but Naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when I have the power to say to myself, \&#39;this ruin, this process, this natural process, makes me want to buck the system.\&#39; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think Naturalism is painting a doomsday portrait of humanity, telling us to give up our powdered wigs and head to the woods. Instead, I think that it is cataloging proofs and experiments, that we are, of course, free to ignore. We can ignore it all we want, if we want to give the Naturalists more corpses to bury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For surely, despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy towards their characters\&#39; likely and catastrophic fate, they are impassioned by readerly inaction and writerly snobisme. I do see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience will understand what\&#39;s to be done with what they see. As has been mentioned, there\&#39;s danger in the hopeless seeing their fate immortalized in stone. There\&#39;s danger in the hopeful disparaging the Natural because it doesn\&#39;t correspond to their world view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don\&#39;t think that the \&#39;hopeful\&#39; need be either wealthy or fortunate. I have not seen it, but it seems that the film American Beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstance as a provider of vision or comfort. There are ascetics as well as gluttons as well as beggars who wonder where within themselves their humanity is, who grieve because they can\&#39;t find anything that separates them from their landscape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Landscapes can be powerfully and beautifully portrayed, but in reality, landscapes do not enact. They change, sure, and dramatically, but only by a large set of Natural law which no one truly have power over. But it cannot be changed itself.&#39;
b&#39;The focus of the key relationship in a young man\&#39;s life, that of his relationship with his father, was excellently portrayed in this movie, &#34;The Greatest Game Ever Played.&#34; The movie captured the essence of how important it is for a father to validate his son and let him know that he has what it takes to follow his dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn\&#39;t matter that economic and social class mores presented obstacles to be overcome by both father and son. It also didn\&#39;t matter that others were acclaiming the son in exuberant celebration. What mattered the most was that he saw his father\&#39;s hand and then his face of approval. The real life challenge for both father and son had been met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that in real life the hero of the story kept his amateur status and became a businessman pretty much verifies that all that went before the match was the training ground for a valid father and son relationship.&#39;
b&#39;I caught this filmshow about the most unlikely, success? ,from a lower league, football team. The plot is thick and roles out some great tenuous twists and turns. Intercut with shots and commentary from the 70\&#39;s .I was taken aback by its shear footy fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great cast includes the excellent Tim Healy as the crazed(drunk) manager , bumbling along hanging on to anything that will make his team win...? I keep remembering bits such as the stolen secret file that Don Revie( Super leeds united and england manager-loved by the fans hated by everyone else)has on Bostock United ( the underfelt men) which in its detailed report of their opposition, Bostock United, in this the FA Cup final, merely says &#34;Sh-te&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of other footy gags a long time before the fantastic feature length &#34;Mike Basset - Football Manager&#34; Starring Ricky Tomlinson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up there with the, Gung ho English beating Germans, at football. Well morally.Although the score lines says different , of &#34;Escape to Victory&#34; ( I still cheer when England score )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the thankless eternal grind of following a really bad team in Micheal Palins &#34;Golden Gordon&#34; from &#34;Ripping Yarns&#34; series ( with Terry Jones)the team were called Bostonworth United ,in case your interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve looked high and low for a copy of Bostock\&#39;s Cup-even Nick Hancock\&#39;s biography doesn\&#39;t list it ( probably someone -not mr hancocks- error)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Play it again or sell me a copy- PLEASE....&#39;
b&#39;As someone who was in a Pan-Hellenic sorority, I wasn\&#39;t sure what to expect when I tuned into this show. After seeing so many over dramatizations in &#34;made for TV movies&#34; and the craziness of the reality shows, I was curious to see if Greek would be able to show the true College and Greek life experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the ever-familiar characters of this genre, but it was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life isn\&#39;t just about parties and petty conflict. Although those things happen within Greek Life, they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout a person\&#39;s life. To characterize it as some exclusive experience to those in a Greek Organization would be false. Most of the story lines and situations taking place in Greek can and do take place everywhere, in every circle of friends, on sports teams, in real life. But I\&#39;ve watched both episodes and my &#34;little sister&#34; whom I\&#39;m still very close to and I have spent both episodes laughing and being reminded of how they\&#39;ve truly captured the spirit of our college years and experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other facets of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie telling Rusty that school comes first and going to your brothers for help, that was very true to life. You can\&#39;t stay in an Organization if you have bad grades. The way Rusty got his assignment to his professor was far fetched, but it was entertaining. Even the dynamic between Casey and Rusty; It happens, you grow up and whatever your relationship with your sibling(s) was, it changes so you must adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: Greek is a great show, great entertainment value, and enough &#34;real life&#34; in there to be believable and definitely worth the viewers time.&#39;
b&#34;It&#39;s just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I&#39;ve seen in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot wasn&#39;t great, but I really didn&#39;t care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other. And the ending leaves it wide open for a 5th sequel (which I hear is in the works). Idle Hands premiers next week and looks to be another horror/comedy, but I doubt it&#39;ll top this one.&#34;
b&#39;Dramatic license - some hate it, though it is necessary in retelling any life story. In the case of &#34;Lucy&#34;, the main points of Lucille Ball\&#39;s teenage years, early career and 20 year marriage to Desi Arnaz are all included, albeit in a truncated and reworked way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main emotional points of Lucy\&#39;s life are made clear: Lucille\&#39;s struggle to find her niche as an actress, finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character Lucy Ricardo a legend; her turbulent, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to Desi Arnaz; Lucy &amp; Desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as TV\&#39;s most memorable sitcom couple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job. Do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one Judy Davis made when playing Judy Garland, but York makes Ball strong-willed yet likable, and is very funny in her own right. Even though her comedic-timing is different than Lucy\&#39;s, she is still believable. The film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set, and her mistreatment of Vivian Vance during the early &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; years, but watching York portray Lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi was, but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with Desi\&#39;s accent, especially in the opening scene. Madeline Zima was decent, if not overly memorable, as the teen-aged Lucy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not featured much, thankfully, since Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in the roles. Not that they aren\&#39;t good actors in their own right, they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing. Most of the actors were from Austrailia and New Zeland, and the repressed accents are detectable at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact, there are many deviations, some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. Jess Oppenheimer, the head writer of Lucy\&#39;s radio show &#34;My Favourite Husband&#34; which began in 1948, is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; in 1951, completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator! This movie also depicts Marc Daniels as being the main &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; director for its entire run, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season! Also, though I figure this was due to budgetary constraints, the Ricardo\&#39;s are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in New York, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is slightly larger and off-scale from the original as well. The Connecticut home looks pretty close to the original, except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s also Desi talking about buying RKO in 1953, during Lucy\&#39;s red-scare incident, even though RKO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes well could have been for dramatic license, and the film does work at conveying the main facts, but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to Oppenheimer and Asher, two vital figures in &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; history? The biggest gaff comes in the &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; recreation scenes, at least a few of them. It\&#39;s always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more so when OBVIOUS CHANGES are made. The scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated, and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away! The &#34;We\&#39;re Having A Baby&#34; number was shortened as well, but other than that it was practically dead on. By far the best was the &#34;grape-stomping&#34; scene, with Rachel York really nailing Lucy\&#39;s mannerisms. The producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the &#34;Vitametavegamin&#34; and candy factory bits, instead showing the actors rehearse them. These scenes proved effective because of that approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film\&#39;s main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about Lucy\&#39;s life, since much is skimmed over or omitted at all. Overall, though, it gives a decent portrait of Lucy &amp; Desi\&#39;s marriage, and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively.&#39;
b&#34;This may actually the finest film of 1999. No I&#39;m not kidding. This documentary directed by Chris Smith captures the very spirit of artistic compulsion. Smith does the smart thing any documentary filmaker should do: he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the viewer watches Mark and his efforts, no matter how funkily aggressive they may prove, to finish his films. He refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result. But lest we forget, remember Speilberg, Scorsese and others started just as humbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a great subject he chooses. Mark, his family and friends are all fascinating characters, far more than any character created in last year&#39;s fictitious cinematic products.This film oscillates on the dime between comedy, tragedy, touching sympathy and leads us ultimately to inspiring any viewer with an urge to create, despite talent issues, to get off their butts and make something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is about maverick artists and their passions. It is also about families, no matter how co-dependent and disfunctional they may be and how unique and beautiful that organism truly is. Mark proves in the film to be utterly devoted not only to his dreams, but also to his family as well- and they to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why this film was not nominated for documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal (that is assuming it was eligible last year). This film is to be sought out and treasured.&#34;
b&#34;Flawlessly directed, written, performed, and filmed, this quiet and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best, and if a person exists who can watch BABETTE&#39;S FEAST without being touched at a very fundamental level, they are a person I do not care to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is quite simple. In the 1800s, two elderly maiden ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities, and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father&#39;s religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women&#39;s youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman, Babette (St\xc3\xa9phane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services, the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined; indeed, the entire village admires and depends upon her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation. The meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected, for Babette&#39;s feast proves to be food for both body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to God and their all-too-human frailties, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of BABETTE&#39;S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul. Highly, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer&#34;
b&#34;Large corporations Vs. Conscientious Do good-ers. We seem to witness events (both real life and reel life) of this sort all the time and most of the time greed wins by employing every means (dirty) necessary and the truth gets suppressed. At least in this movie Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) got his points across and paid for it dearly. We have seen several more movies of this sort being made in the recent years, the most memorable of which was &#39;The Insider&#39; where Russell Crowe played a tobacco industry scientist who tried to blow the whistle claiming that the Industry added more nicotine in cigarettes to make smokers addicted. There was also this reporter-protagonist angle where the reporter is looking for the scoop of his/her dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma where he/she has to choose between righteousness and his livelihood and sometimes his/her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Fonda played reporter Kimberly wells to perfection. She plays a reporter who wishes to pursue serious news whereas her bosses value her more as an &#39;Eye-Candy&#39;. She and her crew (the cameraman played by post-&#39;Coma&#39; Michael Douglas who is also the producer of the movie) witness an accident in a nuclear power plant while they were on a visit. Cameraman Michael Douglas sneakily/illegally gets footage of that event on tape in spite being a no-photography zone and smuggles it out of the station. The station refuses to air it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time the chief engineer Jack Godell launches an investigation of his own and discovers a lot of irregularities in the equipment that&#39;s being used for the reactor. This starts all the dirty politics of corruption and greed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of tension in the audience till the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score to suggest all the scary moments. Now that&#39;s great and unusual in movies. Performances were all good and I love Jack Lemmon. We primarily know him for his comedic roles but he is equally good in dramatic roles. I give this movie an 8/10.&#34;
b&#34;Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10. The trailers on TV portrayed the film as a comedy, and I bugged my parents until they took me. After seeing the movie, I was blown away. I had no idea what to think. Totally different than anything I had seen before, leaving far to many questions for such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I&#39;d watched in in probably 2-3 years, and I still think it&#39;s one of the greatest films made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in top form, as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. The supporting cast are near perfect as well, each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way. The open ending was handled very well, giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end. How this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year&#39;s Oscars is beyond me. If you haven&#39;t seen this film, run to Wal-Mart RIGHT NOW. The DVD is usually in the bargain bin, pick it up! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.5/10&#34;
b&#39;Good show, really good acting, and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting, unpredictable way, especially since, essentially, it\&#39;s two people in a room. It doesn\&#39;t race through like many modern films, but doesn\&#39;t drag, either. Bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the &#34;now&#34; of her character, which is still involved and not going back on her \&#39;career\&#39; choices - so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep, self-examination of her soul...Brundage has the delicate balance of weight, innocence, meekness, and class to pull off \&#39;Buddy\&#39; very well. A bit grainy on the film quality, but it fits the tone of the story. Could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things, but definitely worth watching.&#39;
b&#34;This has got to be the funniest movie I have seen in forever. Chritopher Guest is truly talented. He has a gift for humor. I almost died laughing. Actually, when I saw this in theaters, I considered walking out because the movie was so dumb. But it is dumb in a good way. It is funny-dumb. And this is a really good combination. You will be laughing from start to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the Kennel Club Dog Show. The cast includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O&#39;Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and tons more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing. Someone born without a personality would laugh at this film. It is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.&#34;
b&#34;I was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here. Sure it&#39;s not the best kid&#39;s show, but don&#39;t people stop despising Barney this much after the fifth grade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he&#39;s kinda creepy and strange. I&#39;m fourteen years old, so I know well enough. But here&#39;s the thing. Kids? They LOVE this show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a little kiddie of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, that&#39;s how toddlers are. Even the most patient ones can&#39;t sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There&#39;s too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to get into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then came Barney. I don&#39;t know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that&#39;s so amusing to children, but they sure do love it. I know I did. I was hooked on the show, and wanted to watch it over and over. Yes, the songs kind of drove my parents nuts, but to be able to watch their kids learning, and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span, it&#39;s worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123&#39;s, the magic words and brushing your teeth. I&#39;d grown out of it by five or six, of course, but by that point at least I was a little more patient, and gave my parents a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nieces and nephew all went through the Barney stage growing up, much to their mother&#39;s delight. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains. Of course there&#39;s Big Bird, Ernie, and Oscar, and they&#39;re great, too. But at the toddler stage, it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur. And that&#39;s enough for me.&#34;
b&#39;Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as Sam Marlowe. The music from award winning composer George Duning [From Here To Eternity, Picnic, The World of Suzie Wong], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] are all right on target as famous tv director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets of San Francisco, The Avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. See this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.&#39;
b&#39;Biodoc on the enigmatic singer/songwriter who, according to friends\&#39; accounts, spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life seemingly on a mission of self-destruction. He died at 52, overweight and dissipated, of heart disease, after a protracted rampage of virtually non-stop overindulgence in alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, raucous partying, and flagrant misuse of his vocal instrument (he confided to a friend that he shouted out his lyrics at one performance with such force that spattered blood was left on the microphone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this despite the fact that he was: (1) widely considered to have perhaps the most gifted pop singing ability of his generation; (2) successful, after years of effort, in terms of industry acclaim - a Grammy, an Oscar, a decent recording contract with a top label, and at least two stellar albums - \&#39;Nilsson Schmilsson\&#39; (originals), and \&#39;A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night\&#39; (standards); and (3) very happily married (for the third time), with a lovely young family that he seemed to adore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film\&#39;s strengths begin with the completeness of its account of Nilsson\&#39;s life, including fine use of archival film footage and many stills of Nilsson; the editors do an especially good job of bringing movement to the stills. We learn of his close ties to John Lennon and, later, Ringo Starr (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more impressive are the talking heads, often a documentary\&#39;s weakest aspect. Here we get people like Perry Botkin, Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams, all telling amazing stories about Nilsson \xc2\x96 many uproariously funny, others deeply pathetic - and everyone conveying their deep affection for him. Equally informative and moving are interview segments with Nilsson\&#39;s wives \xc2\x96 Annie and Una, his son Zach, and cousin Doug Hoefer. Best set of heads I can recall in a biodoc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most glaring deficiency of the film is that it crowds out Nilsson\&#39;s music. Even the performance of his greatest hit, &#34;Without You,&#34; is cut short after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh!! There is no excuse for this, not given that the movie runs a full two hours as it is. Lose a few head shots and we could have heard at least that song through, and perhaps one or two more, like &#34;One,&#34; or his Oscar winning cover of &#34;Everybody\&#39;s Talking.\&#39;&#34; The filmmakers are simply too intent on plumbing Nilsson\&#39;s psychological mystique and not attentive enough to his music. My grades: 7.5/10 (low B+) (Seen at the NWFC\&#39;s Reel Music series, 01/07/07)&#39;
b&#34;They just don&#39;t make cartoons like they used to. This one had wit, great characters, and the greatest ensemble of voice over artists ever assembled for a daytime cartoon show. This still remains as one of the highest rated daytime cartoon shows, and one of the most honored, winning several Emmy Awards.&#34;
b&#34;An exquisite film. They just don&#39;t make them like this any more! We eavesdrop on an upper middle class family in Dublin in the early part of the 20th century. They are hosting an after Christmas dinner for their friends and relatives. Their table talk is just idle chatter but it is so well written that one is engrossed. Away from the dinner table some fine piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere as if one were there as one of the guests. Perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player, the odd mistake here and there would have added to the magic of this film. No real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for up and coming film makers.&#34;
b&#39;This is the first American film I have seen at this year and I think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling . As a teenage singer in America,Aaron is not as pop as before,most Americans I met said his song is fake and that he even didn\&#39;t know how to rap.But attention,everyone,he is a kid,how many people can understand him.Being a pop fan is difficult,and being a pop star is more difficult.I think this time Aaron(JD) has shows something real to us.And I think people should learn to understand each other. At another hand,I like the music in the film very much.I remember the first song appeared in the film is &#34;Saturday Night&#34; and it also include some Aaron\&#39;s real live show,And the second one is &#34;One Better&#34;,so I think if you enjoy this film,maybe you\&#39;ll be a pop fan,too. At last,I hope you will have a great time^^ A voice from a Chinese boy.&#39;
b&#39;...means &#34;take up and read&#34;, which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff\&#39;s 1995 New Yorker article of the same name. The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic. It\&#39;s lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out for this young director...he\&#39;s going places.&#39;
b&#34;One of Starewicz&#39;s longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. The dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold, but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. The Mascot features new techniques I have not yet seen in Starewicz&#39;s films. The addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation makes for a new twist on Starewicz&#39;s old style of puppetry. Live scenes of moving cars and people&#39;s feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. The honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and Starewicz&#39;s utilization of the new technology seems like old hat. New puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil&#39;s club scene. Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks. Characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene. Overall, Starewicz is able to update his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work.&#34;
b&#34;This HAS to be my guilty pleasure. I am a HUGE fan of 80&#39;s movies that were designed to entertain and they didn&#39;t care if they offended anyone. This move has no meat, not substance, no deep thought provoking scenes. Just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown, then so be it! This movie is for when you just want to relax and NOT think. Viva la nudity!&#34;
b&#39;The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds. Errol Flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him. Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy never more villainous. Anthony Quinn never more noble than as Crazy Horse. It had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout. The one historical aspect I found most glaringly inaccurate was the final &#34;Last Stand&#34; which occurred on the banks of the Little Big Horn. The film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight. However, I still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of Hollywood\&#39;s golden age.&#39;
b&#39;This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era, but I recommend that all others beware. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there\&#39;s no real pacing or tension in the story. I also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying, partially due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording. I give this a 55/100. Most folks will want to &#34;steer&#34; clear.&#39;
b&#34;It is a rare and fine spectacle, an allegory of death and transfiguration that is neither preachy nor mawkish. A work of mature and courageous insight, Northfork avoids arthouse distinction by refusing to belong to a kind. Unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison, Wim Wenders&#39; 1987 Wings of Desire (Der Himmel \xc3\xbcber Berlin), it sustains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum spanning from the mundane to the supernatural. This story of earthly and celestial eminent domains in the American West withholds the fairytale literalness that marked its German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels shedding their wings with obsequious sentimentalism. Its celestial transcendence, be it inspired by doleful faith or impelled by a fever dream, never parts ways with crud and rot. This firm grounding redounds to great credit for writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.&#34;
b&#39;(This has been edited for space)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chan-wook Park\&#39;s new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body), romance and few other things as well. It\&#39;s a film that has almost too much on its mind. The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case Emile Zola\&#39;s &#34;Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se Raquin&#34;. It\&#39;s an odd mix that doesn\&#39;t always gel, but none the less has an incredible power. Here it is almost 24 hours since I saw the film at Lincoln Center (with a post film discussion by the director) and I find my cage is increasingly rattled. Its not so much what happens is bothersome, its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies, but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood (its not explained) he actually survives. Hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick. Unfortunately all is not well. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. He also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire, and its no not possible for him to go out during the day. Things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family. The priest, some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend. From there it all goes sideways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ever changing film, this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was. It\&#39;s a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else. Its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has enough going on that one could, and people probably will, write books discussing the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance The vampire part of the tale is brilliant. There is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the &#34;affliction&#34; that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside. Sitting in the theater last night I found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked. I think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking. Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. It\&#39;s contrasted with what happens later, it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn\&#39;t going to work. Its not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, rather its something else. I personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible. (The sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool) The romance is also wonderfully handled. Sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done, but it\&#39;s the other stuff, the looks, the talk, the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special. I love the looks, the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act, the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected, and the mad passion of possible consummation. This is one of the great screen romances of all time. It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love (and lust). If you\&#39;ve ever loved deeply I\&#39;m guessing you\&#39;ll find some part of your hear on screen, I know I did. The statement &#34;I just wanted to spend eternity with you&#34; has a sad poignancy to it. It\&#39;s both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion. The tragic romance will break your heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won\&#39;t lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great. Its not, as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great (especially the actors who I have unjustly failed to hail as amazing) the whole doesn\&#39;t always come together. The various genres, thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other. Frequently I was wondering where the film was going. I hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the film a great deal. I loved the pieces more than the film as a whole. Its been pinging around in my head since I saw it, and I\&#39;m guessing that it will do so for several days more. Like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward. One of the meatiest and most filling films of the year.&#39;
b&#34;Nostalgia isn&#39;t always the best reason to watch a movie. More often than not, the movies you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult. While there are exceptions to this rule, it&#39;s hard to justify owning a DVD of Krull, regardless of how many insightful the director&#39;s commentary may be. But stay sharp Gen X/Y&#39;ers, because the dozens of disappointments dominating your trip down memory lane, might stop you from stumbling across one worth revisiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One surprise film worth another look is Joel Schumacher&#39;s Flatliners, the supernatural thriller starring 80&#39;s popcorn heavyweights Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. You would think that a stew comprised of this cast, the flamboyant flair of Schumacher and the \xc3\xbcber slick eye of cinematographer Jan De Bont would result in something sickeningly stodgy, but calories aside... Flatliners ain&#39;t half bad. Even though it&#39;s production design is inexplicably over-the-top and the photography is achingly over- stylized (replete with neon soaked streets spewing endless billows of steam), Flatliners still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller. If there&#39;s an explanation why Flatliners was forgotten, it might be because 1990 saw the release of another, far superior, supernatural thriller: Jacob&#39;s Ladder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had Flatliners been released a year or two after Jacob&#39;s Ladder, it&#39;s likely Schumacher&#39;s flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down, commercialized rip-off of Adrian Lyne&#39;s nightmarish masterpiece. But with these films being released in the same year, Flatliners enjoyed a different fate, tripling JL&#39;s take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise. The passage of time hasn&#39;t been as kind to Flatliners, it has been lost atop a dated heap of throwaway 80&#39;s Brat Pack dreck, while JL has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. Fates aside, JL is seamlessly terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame, whereas Flatliners falls victim to over- simplification and Hollywood conveniences that drag down the final act into a predictably tidy denouement. Comparisons between the two movies is unfair, and ultimately overlooks Flatliners ability to represent the 80&#39;s at its quintessential best. Released at the end of a decade of shallow excess, Flatliners will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles, but in fairness, it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at (or at least near) the top of its particular heap of dreck. For intents and purposes, it&#39;s an entertaining walk down memory lane.&#34;
b&#34;This excellent movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery is long overdue for release in DVD form. The same can be said for her earlier, also excellent movie, A Case of Rape. I can only hope that my comments spur some enterprising soul into placing BOTH Elizabeth Montgomery movies on one DVD to be made available to her many fans. I for one believe this excellent actress&#39;s role was unfortunately stereotyped by her role on Bewitched and, as a result, more serious acting roles were not made available to her. I am confident that if these two movies, perhaps even a trilogy with The Legend of Lizzie Borden, were released in DVD form, her fans would set the record straight on how highly they regard her serious acting abilities.&#34;
b&#34;Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. Haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And amazingly touching after Haines&#39;s character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. The new, humility-filled Haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against Navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. Great, rousing entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula film, shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. The handsome-but-goony character would be played by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others in later decades, another take on the beautiful-but-daffy dames played by Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. West Point is a winner!&#34;
b&#34;I recently purchased Lost Horizon on ebay, having vivid memories of the Things I Will Not Miss number from childhood (I am an ancient 29). I also recently finished the novel upon which it is based. I was so pleasantly surprised to find a genuine hidden treasure. A wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly told story, subtly updated from the original film (and by now quite a separate entity to the far more intellectual and thought provoking book by James Hilton). Sally Kellerman in particular has a radiant presence as the suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes, who gradually warms to the charms of Shangri-La. Only Liv Ullmann flounders in her wooden portrayal of the schoolteacher (a role far more suited to a Julie Andrews type. The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hussey are all dubbed isn&#39;t important as it is almost impossible to tell. The songs DO vary in quality, the music being far superior to the lyrics but it is still a vibrant and engrossing film that really deserves a proper DVD release and a lot more recognition.&#34;
b&#34;league of gentleman has been the most disturbing British sitcom to be on t.v and how can a funny movie be so bad rated,they just have no taste this film will make you want to watch over and over again and still find it funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is surprising that it has done bad but it is British the cinema do crap most of the time but this time it (in my words) a boost with comedy with a giraffe spunks over Lady&#39;s, this is a top British comedy and better than dodge-ball, so by this and it won&#39;t prove you wrong as i don&#39;t really laugh through films but this film was amazing through comedy with the best characters but i was a bit disappointed of how much Edward and Tabb&#39;s were in there for back to typing buy this film and it won&#39;t disappoint you.&#34;
b&#34;what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person&#39;s past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;live and let live&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.&#34;
b&#39;There is no need for me to repeat the synopsis rendered by Glenn. The black and white rendition is even more powerful in portraying the bleakness of country village life at that time. The deep measure of friendship shown by Babette toward the two elderly sisters touches the heart strings. The supporting cast is excellent and their performances superb, it would not be fair to single out any one character since the entire story depends on the cast as a whole. I cannot put my finger exactly on why I rate this movie so highly since I am not a professional critic; individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating since enjoyment of this type of movie is always in the eye of the beholder.&#39;
b&#34;TV newscaster Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical camerman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens. The plants managers play it down but Adams has filmed it all. Wells and Adams try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it. Plant executive Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) realizes there are serious problems and tests have been falsified. He tries to get executives to believe him--only they know it. Wells, Adams and Godell find all their lives are in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this in a movie theatre in 1979. I was only 17 and it scared me silly. To make matters worse the Three Mile Island accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real. Seeing it over 20 years later it doesn&#39;t scare me but it still is an excellent film--it works as a mystery, a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry. Fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as Wells--she perfectly conveys her character&#39;s growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out. He was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award for this. Douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by Lemmon and Fonda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really great film--one of the best of the 70s. Don&#39;t miss this one!&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;m Czech and soldiers (not only pilots) who escaped Czechoslovakia after Nazi\&#39;s invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and bravest men in our history for me. This movie from director of Academy Award winner &#34;Kolya&#34; (1996) is a tribute to these men. It\&#39;s first big-screen movie about Czechoslovak WWII soldiers since &#34;Nebesti jezdci&#34; (1968). I think &#34;Dark Blue World&#34; is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, nice music etc. Movie is half in English and some actors are Britons. But greatest thing about this movie is it\&#39;s pure existence. It\&#39;s great chance to show people all around the world (and to many people in Czech Republic too...) that Czechoslovak role in WWII was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leading characters are older and wiser Frantisek and young Karel. They escaped together from Czechoslovakia, they are flying in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman... Maybe it\&#39;s a clich\xc3\xa9 but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including great dogfights). I don\&#39;t want to compare &#34;Dark Blue World&#34; with &#34;Pearl Harbor&#34;, someone will like PH more and someone will like DBW. But if you like happy ends, DBW is not for you. So, I think it\&#39;s very good movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very good movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovak history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, main theme &#34;Dark Blue World&#34; is from Czech 30\&#39;s and 40\&#39;s composer Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this theme when he lost his eyes...&#39;
b&#34;Plunkett &amp; Macleane falls into my favourite genre of film (historical action adventure with comedy) which is probably why I rate it so highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action centres around a highwayman (Plunkett) and a layabout &#39;gentleman&#39; who gets entangled with him and his schemes (Macleane). This leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy. There is also, of course, a love interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant, larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment.&#34;
b&#39;The third film from the Polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, imaginative film yet. Though many audiences will have a problem with Northfork\&#39;s lack of traditional dramatic structure, &#34;Stick with it, Jack!&#34;. The plot is difficult to summarize, so just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, God in a cowboy hat, the selling of angel wings, and a sick orphan (but it all works). M. David Mullen\&#39;s extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at. The performances of the actors, working with the Polish Brothers\&#39; inspiringly offbeat script, are pitch-perfect and give the film its emotional punch. The strong-willed audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story, the comic and moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and command that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience. A great, great, great movie!!!&#39;
b&#34;Seth McFarlane is a true genius. He has crafted a show that is witty, culturally sharp and just downright hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that think its &#39;offensive&#39; take on social or cultural topics makes no meaningful comment, just causes &#39;offence&#39;, can be pointed to this quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter (coming out of the stem cell lab): How long was I in there? // Guard: Five minutes. // Peter: Why aren&#39;t we funding this?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks family guy, for being not only the funniest show on TV (with the possible exception of the much loved, much missed futurama), but for also being pretty clever to boot.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;m normally not a Drama/Feel good movie kind of guy, but once I saw the trailer for &#34;Radio&#34;, I couldn\&#39;t resist. Not only is this a great film, but it also has grreat acting. Cuba Gooding Jr. did an excellent job portraying James Robert Kennedy, a.k.a. &#34;RAdio.&#34; Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well. So for a great story, great acting, and a little comedy, I give &#34;Radio&#34; a 10 out of 10!&#39;
b&#34;The first feature length Muppet Movie, and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol, the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos, keeps to a simple but original plot, classic Muppet lame jokes, Paul Williams genius in song writing, and Electric Mayhem madness, and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. Only Croft has come close to Hensen&#39;s genius with puppets. Half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor/actress still alive???? I can only hope Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive Kermit and Company from the deadly grasp of Disney.&#34;
b&#34;While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it is better than most over all. I mean it had it&#39;s little laughs and just all around a good feeling. It&#39;s not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes. Walter and Jack had such a great chemistry together as friends/brother in-laws. Just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had game! :D I loved just the whole plot of being able to move on and having fun no matter how old you are. I&#39;d recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#34;
b&#34;This is the greatest show ever made next to south park. I love this show! it is so funny, and Peter&#39;s laugh is hilarious. You need to watch this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before. One of my favorite shows of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can, try to see some of the later episodes such as I dream of Jesus, or Tales of a third grade nothing. But there&#39;s never been an episode I didn&#39;t like. All of the episodes are absolutely hilarious. It&#39;s got a great satire to it as well. You can find a lot of clips on you tube. If you&#39;re somewhere near a computer or a TV see it right away however you can.&#34;
b&#34;Operation Scorpio (AKAThe Scorpion King) doesn&#39;t slip into top gear until the last 25 minutes or so, but when the action does hit top speed, it delivers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that demand the viewer&#39;s attention. That is not to say that the first hour is worthless\xc2\x97 just that compared to the final fight-fest, it seems a bit underwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot revolves around Yuk-Su, a talented comic artist who dreams of being a hero\xc2\x97just like those he depicts in his drawings. When Yuk-Su rescues a young maid, Siu-Yu, who is being sold into prostitution, he incurs the wrath of her evil boss, Wa. Led by Sonny, master of scorpion style kung fu, Wa&#39;s henchmen give chase to Yuk-Su and the maid. Yuk-Su&#39;s father intervenes but he is injured. After being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders, the three eventually hide out at a noodle restaurant, owned by their friend, Master Yat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuk-Su learns to cooks noodles, but also regularly sneaks out in order to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the tutelage of Jean, the teacher of the musclebound hulks who rescued them. When Master Yat must leave on business, Yuk-Su is left in charge of the kitchen; however, he pops out to practise his skills with Jean, leaving Siu-Yu to serve the customers. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and, disgusted by the noodles they are served, trash the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Master Yat learns that Yuk-Su has been sneaking out, he tells him that he should have learnt kung fu from him; it transpires that Master Yat used to be a top Triad assassin, until he decided to try and change his ways. Under the guidance of Master Yat, Yuk-Su improves his skills, even learning the art of the shadowless kick! Yuk-Su eventually gets a chance to try and become a real hero when his friend, Fatty, announces that his maid has also been sold into prostitution. With Jean, they visit Wa posing as French brothel keepers looking for new women. When Fatty&#39;s maid is presented to them, she accidentally blows their ruse and at last the action kicks off big style. Despite his best efforts, Jean is badly beaten by Sonny and he and Yuk-Su are forced to flee. On returning to the restaurant, Yuk-Su finds it ablaze; and worst of all, the bad guys have found Siu-Yu! Yuk Su, accompanied by Master Yat, returns to Wa&#39;s place to try and rescue Siu-Yu...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite some fairly entertaining training scenes, the slow build up to the final action at Wa&#39;s house is rather too drawn out and devoid of any serious fight scenes. It is a shame that the tedium wasn&#39;t broken up by a decent scrap midway, rather than saving all of the juicy stuff until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last fight, however, is worth the wait in the end; Won Jin gives a jaw dropping performance as the high kicking Sonny who scuttles, flips and spins with amazing skill and dexterity, and Chin Kar-Lok gives a solid performance as Yuk-Su, the artist-turned-fighter. Also particularly good is old-school kung fu star Lau Kar-Leung (AKA Liu Chia Liang) as Master Yat, proving that this old-timer has still got what it takes to kick ass! Although not a perfect film, Operation Scorpio has enough standout action in its finale to definitely warrant a viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB. I may have got some of the names wrong. My DVD calls characters by different names than those listed on IMDb.&#34;
b&#34;This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The acting and plot aren&#39;t that impressive, but the lines just keep on coming. This catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like, well, a bad movie, but it&#39;s so kooky that you can&#39;t help but be amused. The spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going... I was especially fond of Sharon, the Canuck on Shrooms eh? However, the one that really stole the show was Richard&#39;s little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden), his high pitched whining was somehow endearing. The whole movie rocked.&#34;
b&#39;Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn\&#39;t understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I\&#39;ve ever seen, yet it\&#39;s not dark or preachy like the &#34;ordinary people&#34; type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear\&#39;s &#34;Midsummer Nights\&#39; Dream.&#34; Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn\&#39;t miss a beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable. It\&#39;s like re-reading a favorite, treasured book.&#39;
b&#34;As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and though I had heard of the series in passing, I never really realized exactly what it was. It was, then, with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth Doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy) but cooler. I can&#39;t believe what I&#39;ve been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before? My entire childhood was deprived of Doctor Who adventures; me being a tremendous fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. Honestly, i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that at first I was not so sure that Billie Piper would be the best actress but I&#39;m happy to say that she did very well, i thought, and added a very realistic touch to the series. I think, actually, that was one of my favourite aspects of the series; the contrast between great alien conflict scenes contrasted with the infuriating normality of the South London Council Estate life. I&#39;m always interested in instances where people&#39;s ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it may fit in with their mundane lives. I also loved Christopher Eccleston. I haven&#39;t seen many of his films and I&#39;ve never seen another actor as Dr Who, but I thought his portrayal of the Doctor was brilliant, immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder. I find that many other characters with his sort of character history tend to be a bit two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seems slightly shallow. This Doctor, on the other hand, earned my loyalty with his stratified personality. I agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects, aliens and whatnot, might have been a bit more effective. but then again, this isn&#39;t about special effects (though they help) from what I&#39;ve read and heard from long-time Dr Who fans; it&#39;s the spirit of the whole things that really counts. And I don&#39;t think they did a bad job with what they had. I quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the Daleks; if I ever knew anything about Dr Who before watching the series, it was that there were things in it that looked like upturned dustbins on wheels. Previous to watching, i was quite sceptical about these pepper-pots threatening the existence of humanity but some of them were quite scary! Which I loved,of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good show. I look forward to future episodes with delight. The Doctor has a new fan.&#34;
b&#34;This covers just about every area of the creative process, and goes through the three stages chronologically, with the main focus squarely placed on the production. There are documentaries that go into more detail, and cover the other two groups better. This consists of artwork, behind-the-scenes footage, clips of the movie, and many interviews. With a running time that comes in at just over two hours the audience is entitled to a lot of information, given that this is nearly the same length that the film itself is. It could be argued that a lot of the time is spent on the people, with the craft and the result of their collaborative efforts coming in second. This is well-done, with tight editing. It gets into the technology some, and reveals how certain effects were achieved. This spends a lot of time on the physical training, in preparation for the fighting and such. You do get nice candid shots of the people, crew and actors alike. The Ultimate Matrix 10-Disc Set of this also holds nearly three hours of music, in a simple system, with individual track selection and a Play All function, about 38 minutes worth of BTS material in addition to the title itself, in various featurettes. The original release, however, has several very brief extras, including clips of the making of the sequels, a preview of The Animatrix and Yuen Wo Ping&#39;s Blocking Tapes(a complete run-through of a couple of the biggest martial arts sequences, with stunt performers and almost the exact cinematography, with the same shots and angles of those bits in the finished silver screen effort). The language is quite strong, but rather infrequent, nearly non-existent. I recommend either version of this to anyone who enjoys the concept, and/or wants to know about how they put the first one together. 7/10&#34;
b&#39;Absolute grabber of a movie, and given its age, years ahead of its time. I first saw this the week my dad came home with a neighbor\&#39;s TV, that the guy had thrown on the scrap heap. A tinkerer with all things electrical, dad had it working inside two days. This was July 1955...and then probably only the third house in the street to HAVE television! Pretty much the first thing we ever saw on that grainy and flickering old 12-inch screen was THIS film. &#34;It\&#39;s pretty OLD dear,&#34; I recall my mom telling me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost 50 years on, and it doesn\&#39;t seem any older - rather like World War I in that respect! Terrific little fantasy about a London omnibus carrying thirteen passengers, that crashes, killing one of their number. Then, in flashback we pick up on the lives of these people and what brought them to being on this bus that very day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to the crash at the end of the film, the victim\&#39;s identity is revealed, perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 movie THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ever you come across this little gem, I suggest you watch it!&#39;
b&#34;Ok, so there&#39;s always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because they&#39;re good, but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be, or whether they&#39;re from a foreign country. All that aside, One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be. The jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la Bobcat Goldthwait), surreal (Bobcat under the inspired direction of Steve Holland), and dry (John Cusack, one of the most morosely dry and funny actors in American cinema), and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line (ok, except Demi Moore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#39;s immature, yes, it&#39;s screw-ball, yes, Bobcat dresses up like Godzilla and trashes a scale-model of a seafood restaurant. It&#39;s also funny as hell. Watch it.&#34;
b&#39;We all enjoyed the movie. It is a very charming family film with many fun cameos. It was fun to see Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the film as well as turns by famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the film however all the children are good. The west Texas scenery is great as is the soundtrack full of Texas artists. The last half seemed a bit far fetched to me, however, my son was interested throughout the film which is not so often with him. Something in the storyline was captivating for children. Having shown calves as a child, I really liked the ending. That is definitely not the way it really works unless you have heifers.&#39;
b&#39;Insanely well crafted mini-series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS. Was heavily promoted at the time. I believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full length production was shown I believe only once during its first broadcast. Was 6-8 hours total. This length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours. Cut some interesting, but slow scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete, not edited version to DVD. Not worth creating a VHS version at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would fit in very well in the mini-series or dramatic history genre.&#39;
b&#34;Although this movie doesn&#39;t have the darkness of the books, it is in my opinion a great movie. It&#39;s great campy fun with the beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat. He may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and Lestat is most definitely about looking good. He moves like the predator I always imagined Lestat would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It&#39;s not Interview with the Vampire, so don&#39;t try to compare the two. Interview is Louis&#39; story. This is a cut and paste version of Lestat&#39;s. In any case, I highly recommend.&#34;
b&#34;At first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love, but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don&#39;t have.The first time i saw it i couldn&#39;t see it complete because i had to leave.But while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn&#39;t have any opportunity by then.One year went by until i saw this movie in a not-free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too.I saw it once,twice...until 200 times and not kidding.I did know all the dialogues by hart and i don&#39;t know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored.And i have to say that I&#39;m not used to see a movie more than twice.The act is very good.Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too.I would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it.On balance,it&#39;s a movie i can&#39;t take out of my mind.&#34;
b&#39;This movie would had worked much better if this was the first Critters movie, this is a low-budget movie with only two (2) Critters shown on-screen. Why this looks like a fail is because this is the last Critters movie and it\&#39;s so low-budget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money. However, I did like this movie, I compare it mostly with the third movie (which were bad). Critters 4 have a more serious tone in it, the first half of the movie (even without seeing one Critter yet) you have a scary feeling watching it, too bad they didn\&#39;t &#34;milk&#34; out the Critters, I mean even if they only had two (2) puppets they could still have used them on-screen a lot more. The Critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special, especially at the end with the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise. Lastly I liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series, so at least we won\&#39;t see a Critters 5 anymore. Oh, one last thing, I missed one scene in this movie, we never see a Critter shoot a spike from its back, maybe these puppets didn\&#39;t have that feature, but I was very disappointed not seeing that (in Critters 3 we see a lot of spike shooting, which was the only good thing I liked about that movie).&#39;
b&#34;This was a great movie, and safe for the entire family (which one doesn&#39;t see much of anymore. My wife and I and 15 year-old son loved it. Even though you had an inkling of how it would end, it continued to be a fun journey, and the final ending surprised us. There should be more movies like this!!!&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Are You in the House Alone?&#34; belongs to the pre-cable TV days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It is well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. Kathleen Beller plays a High School student who gets a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller\&#39;s parents, Ellen Travolta (John\&#39;s sister) is the High School Principal and Dennis Quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid. It\&#39;s a competent chiller with a still relevant social message. Beller is lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters. Blythe Danner, who I usually don\&#39;t like, gives a truly moving performance. Nice little film.&#39;
b&#39;Man, I never laugh so much this year, and it\&#39;s pretty hard to make me laugh. While I expected some Hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed &#34;victim&#34; messing the whole set until she finally &#34;die&#34;. Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that Mute Witness is not a typically horror movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character, the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. Her performance is top-notch; her character can\&#39;t speak, so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate.And, oh boy, she did a wonderful job. Her sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or the fianc\xc3\xa9e or the wife of the &#34;in-film director&#34; (Evan Richards). They were both very funny most of the time. I won\&#39;t spoil more, but the scenes following the bathtub moment, with them two, the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot get twisted near the end, possibly misleading at one particular moment. But don\&#39;t worry. Such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-/girl-/friend.&#39;
b&#34;Most people attending this film will have no idea of the great novel by Arthur Miller that is the basis of it. It&#39;s a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and alters peoples lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. The eyeglasses his boss makes him get change everything he has worked for and his whole world collapses around him, little by little. There couldn&#39;t have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than William H. Macy. Not only is he a talented stage and screen actor, but he projects honesty behind every character he plays. He is an everyday man caught in his own insecurities. His anxiety intensifies when he takes a stand and walks out of his job. Suddenly, he has to confront the issues he has tried to avoid all his middle class existence in the Brooklyn of the 40s. Is he Jewish, is he not? The cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film, directed with sure hand by Neil Slavin, kept reminding me of some Edward Hopper&#39;s paintings, especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when Newman steps outside a building and the night shot when he and his wife are being followed with long black shadows behind the couple, menacing and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies. Laura Dern, David Paymer, and especially Meat Loaf, who infuses incredible depth to the bully-next-door, are excellent, but they all pale in comparison with the stellar turn of William H. Macy (H must stand for HONEST..) If you haven&#39;t read the book, I would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more truly and convincingly than Arthur Miller has.&#34;
b&#39;What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? You\&#39;d think so by some of the reviews. Al Adamson\&#39;s films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go into them knowing that already it helps, and they aren\&#39;t necessarily to be taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. First off, this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits, so you know things are looking promising. This is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital. Of course Nurse Sherri tends to his needs and all, and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her. And Nurse Sherri begins to change. No longer the nice nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There\&#39;s a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of Sherri\&#39;s co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo. This is not bad if you\&#39;re a cult film fan, but it may be bad if you\&#39;re a &#34;Spiderman&#34; fan because you won\&#39;t like it. At times this actually lurches towards &#34;respectability&#34; (for Adamson, anyway) but then it &#34;unredeems: itself with some ridiculous event. If you enjoy Adamson\&#39;s films and similar trash you may well like this, for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure, keep digging. 7 out of 10.&#39;
b&#34;L&#39;Appartement is, I think, a very purposeful Hitchcockian film. The plot was rife with symbolism (ie the white and red roses) and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly. The look was very Parisian and pulled you closer to the story. I saw it in London and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states&#34;
b&#34;You gotta love the spaghetti western universe. The vision of a west where good guys get shot point blank with no warning, cartoonish villains chew the scenery in extreme close-ups, and the anti-hero walks away from the girl in the end. A lot of people call Corbucci&#39;s films &#39;depressing&#39;. I find that a bit dodgy as far as descriptions go. I think bleak and unforgiving are more apt mostly because &#39;depressing&#39; suggests a level of sentimentality almost every Eurowestern director ignored in favour of painting characters in broad strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GLI SPECIALISTI must be seen in all its widescreen glory before it can take its proper place in the Sergio Corbucci canon. It&#39;s a beautiful movie. And it makes sense that Corbucci wanted to blow off some steam with COMPANEROS after the unremitting one two punch of THE GREAT SILENCE and this (although he would later revert back to his usual tricks with the foulmouthed SONNY AND JED). There&#39;s still a certain amount of caricature that detracts from the overall grimness of the movie, imo it hurts more than does any good to have a needless inclusion of three kids dressed like hippies skulking around town in search of gold and trouble. And it hurts to have Mario Adorf playing Mexican one-handed bandit El Diablo as over the top as he always plays his characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those minor gripes aside there&#39;s more than enough here to wet the palate of the spaghetti aficionado. Shootouts galore, the population of an entire town reduced to crawling naked in the dirt, the typical iconic badassitude of the laconic antihero (played by Johnny Halliday), the moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the movie. Corbucci might never receive the acclaim of the more famous Sergio or the American patriarchs of the genre but you and I know that&#39;s a gross injustice for a very talented director. His dynamic shot selection, in depth staging with objects sticking close to the camera and receding in the background, his flair for quick pacing and feverish energy in moving a story that wasn&#39;t always all that along, the way he photographs open spaces, everything in his work makes me sure that if Corbucci was American and had emerged 15 years later along with Mann and Hawks, the Cahiers du Cinema critics would have lauded him as an auteur worthy of serious critical consideration.&#34;
b&#34;Although I was hoping that I&#39;d like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. There were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what I&#39;d call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. I also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for I don&#39;t think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim. All things considered, it fell a little short of my expectations, but I&#39;m still very glad that I finally sat down to watch this movie.&#34;
b&#34;I remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race. I was a 13 year old, living in England. The previous year Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis; he was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. I remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white TV!) and then his knighting by the Queen. It provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK. It all seems so quaint now. Chichester became a national hero, but he had stopped half way, in Australia, to re-fit his yacht, so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to attempt the journey without stopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s important to remember that this was a world pre-GPS, when communications on land were still pretty erratic, never mind in the middle of the ocean. Now with GPS receivers that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a metre anywhere on earth, it&#39;s hard to recall a time when you could go to sea and quite literally, vanish. As Donald Crowhurst did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of yachtsmen signed up (all men back then), including mystery man, Crowhurst. Essentially a weekend sailor, Crowhurst had not been a spectacular success in any previous enterprise, including careers in the British Army, the Air Force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids. He wanted to do something big with his life, and he saw the five thousand pound first prize (well over $100,000 in today&#39;s money) and the ensuing publicity as a means of kick starting his business. He signed a deal with a sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat, and which meant failure would bankrupt him, and soon found himself a popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race. Now the Brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the &#39;pros&#39;. (Think Eddie the Eagle losing endless Olympic ski jump competitions, and the amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National horse race.) The public queued up to see him set off, but his boat wasn&#39;t really ready, and even as he started (the last competitor to leave the UK) Crowhurst must have known he didn&#39;t seriously have a chance. But too much was riding on him to quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife&#39;s face. Left behind with their 4 children, she is interviewed movingly throughout the film, together with one of Crowhurst&#39;s sons. She was in a no-win situation. Had she attempted to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but afterward she was riven with doubt, as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him. Faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never make it through the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and ignominy, Crowhurst devised a plan to cheat. Laid up offshore Argentina and Brazil, out of radio contact, he waited for the leaders to round Cape Horn and start back up the Atlantic, thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe. He elaborately falsified his logs, and made 16mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan. But as one after another the other competitors dropped out, he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his logs would be scrutinized. Unable to face certain detection, his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide. His yacht was found. He never was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beautifully edited film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic French sailor, who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize, when he abruptly left the race, unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face, and sailed into the wide blue yonder, eventually pulling up some 10 months later in Tahiti. Having spent some seven years working at sea myself, (albeit on very different ships to these) I well understand the pull of the ocean. Standing on deck, seeing water in every direction to the horizon, knowing there&#39;s a couple of miles of water below you, nothing between you and oblivion but a thin metal hull, without easy access to TV or radio (even nowadays on most working ships, you feel pretty isolated), it&#39;s possible to truly escape from the responsibilities of everyday life for a while. There is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long, lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind. Most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough, but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardships at sea, the search for self. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, the ex navy guy who won the race (and many since) probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off, which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route. Those who went searching for something profound within themselves, may not have entirely liked what they found. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marvelous archive footage of Britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this, (did it really look quite that bad? I don&#39;t remember it looking quite so dowdy, but perhaps we blot out the worst aspects of the past?) but overall, it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie. Highly recommended.&#34;
b&#39;This late 50s French study of disaffected youth (in their early 20\&#39;s, actually--&#34;grown up&#34;, but not yet settled down into the adult world) probably missed the mark by a mile in terms of being an accurate depiction of 1958 French youth (don\&#39;t virtually ALL youth films made by adults do this? The ones that don\&#39;t--River\&#39;s Edge comes to mind-- are rare indeed), but director-writer Marcel Carne, of Les Enfants du Paradis fame, is too accurate an observer of humanity to NOT provide an insightful view of the essence of these characters. In a sense, the details are not important--you could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as well--but the loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and self-righteous anger of the characters is captured well. The young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo are in supporting roles, but leads Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit, and Andrea Parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth. There is also a fine jazz score, which you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARIS--JAZZ &amp; CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who have commented on the film, I don\&#39;t really see director-writer Carne as sitting in judgment on these characters--he seems as though he is an objective observer to me. Of course, these middle-class characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to whine about to some working-class viewers of the film, and I think Carne is certainly aware of this. For this American viewer (I watched a dubbed, fairly literally I\&#39;d say, version of this titled THE CHEATERS), the film provides an interesting window into the France of the 1950s. It also is self-consciously poetic (the scene on the ledge, saving the cat, is but one example of this) and has intellectual aspirations in that charming way that only French films can get away with--I can imagine the heavy-handed, melodramatic, shallow way this kind of material would have been handled by an American studio production, and the sensationalistic, moralistic, suggestive way this kind of material would have been handled by American drive-in/exploitation filmmakers. I feel that Marcel Carne has captured the essence of that period between, say, high school graduation and when, by one\&#39;s early 30s, people have largely settled into a routine, whatever that routine may be. Those willing to watch the film with an open mind and not fire away at the many easy targets it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties. And even if you don\&#39;t want to do that, you can go in the other room while the film is playing and simply enjoy the fine soundtrack, with great 50s jazz and instrumental pop, including the wonderful original score by an American &#34;Jazz at the Philharmonic&#34; group including Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz (spelled &#34;goetz&#34; in the credits), Roy Eldridge, and Ray Brown.&#39;
b&#39;On seeing this movie, I didn\&#39;t expect much. I was delightfully surprised. Although the writing was unpolished, as some of the dialog seemed drawn-out and contrived, the script did have shining moments. (My favorite line, &#34;Life is like a rich meringue, an-and I\&#39;m diabetic, so I can\&#39;t enjoy it...&#34;.) The plot was new and refreshing as opposed to some of the newer more &#34;main-stream&#34; horror that most of us are (sadly) growing used to. I do believe some of the scenes could (should) have been longer (and maybe some shorter). The superfluous use of blood was campy but seemed to make sense in the end....Ah, the end. The end would have been a little better if they had explained why what happened, happened. (I don\&#39;t wanna spoil it.) It might have also added to the movie time, which is in the area of &#34;it\&#39;s only an hour long, how good could it be?&#34; Answer- Quite good.&#39;
b&#34;Hilary was great as julie, and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references towards the other three movies! I mean, come on! First off, Where&#39;s Daniel!? Miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and that&#39;s it. Daniel was his best friend and should&#39;ve at least made an appearance in the movie. He could&#39;ve helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the flip side, the music stayed true to the movie though, with a little more instrumentation(Fretless Bass)to accompany the wonderfully played Pan-Flute! It doesn&#39;t feel like a Karate Kid movie unless you hear that Pan-Flute! Thank you Zamfir! Overall, a decent movie though! We miss you Noriyuki!&#34;
b&#39;The problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in. People come looking for a B-Grade horror film, or a &#34;So Bad It\&#39;s Good&#34; movie. Jack Frost 2 is neither of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, to put it simply, a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one. To view it as anything other than a screwball comedy (easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless &#34;Scary Movies&#34; combined) is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level. It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premise is simple; the characters from the first movie, haunted by memories of Jack Frost, take a vacation to a tropical island. A new, improved Jack comes after them, now with essentially the powers of Hydro-Man from Spider-Man; essentially, he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly, divide himself, multiply himself, and, worst of all, he\&#39;s managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness...AntiFreeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What\&#39;s sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first Jack Frost (a simply HORRIBLE movie) can\&#39;t appreciate the change of tone for the sequel. Just as Alien was a horror film and Aliens was all about action, Jack Frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and Jack Frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the entertainment comes the live action actors, who serve admirably. Particularly funny among them are Ray Tooney (playing a caricature of a retired British Colonel from the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (offering an insane, hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film), and David Allen Brooks (taking the once serious role of manners to new, totally bizarre heights).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of &#34;memorable quotes&#34; disturbs me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of The Mutant Killer Snowman, rates a zero. But you have to understand, IT\&#39;S NOT A HORROR MOVIE.&#39;
b&#34;Unfortunately this original mix of action and laughs is kept from cinema fans as it sits rotting in the Columbia vaults for all eternity. A shame since this may be Jack Starrett&#39;s strongest film and features a witty script by a young Terrence Malick and fully realized performances by its two leads Stacey Keach and Frederic Forrest who turn to a life of crime so they can get the money to open a seafood restaurant. Many standout scenes include interrogation by bathtub and electric razor, and an intense shootout in an abandoned building as it&#39;s being torn down by a wrecking ball!&#34;
b&#39;Yul Brynner was a symbol of villein in the tine of 50,s , he play a role of Russian leader in Hungary at the time of revolution in this country in 1956 that made it against the Marxism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from Hungary to England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the Hungarian Resistance to kill the Russian major(Yul Brynner) in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from his bad works , but at the end he made a good work to help Deborah Kerr for escaping her and her darling to London to write in his book a good working to gain at the end people,s agreement and trustment after his assassination by the Hungarian Resistance.&#39;
b&#39;The GREAT NEWS is that this film is now AVAILABLE on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video.This is good news as it is one of my favourite films!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched this film for the first time in the 80s and it is compulsory holiday viewing. Living in the small market town called Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions,of reenactments,and traditions we are also a cosy tight community. We are now also faced with large housing developments which threaten to destroy the Community and you can see why I love this film First of all-and most important, there are LASHINGS of snow!!!! Then there is the lovely legend of the Christmas Tree and also the Christian denouement as all the community cough up the money to help the destitute farmer save his farm and stay in the community. The evil developers-only after the money are sent packing as the whole town pledge their money to help protect what they have , which is very special. I love the way the whole community send their message to Santa via the post office which is misunderstood by the hero . He and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family. (There is a likely candidate for this)-even a sleigh ride and most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on Christmas morning and no-one had engineered it! There is a lovely moment where Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. Great gentle film for everything Christmas is really about.&#39;
b&#34;I know this film has had a fairly rough ride from the critics, but I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. He never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all of his varied disguises. He also manages to radiate a sweet charm that belies his outrageous pratfalls. Special mention must also go to Michael Gambon who plays for laughs with a brilliantly accurate and yet comedic inner city Dublin accent. The only weak link is Caine who, while obviously having a great laugh hamming it up, plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character. It probably won&#39;t play that well overseas but it&#39;s well worth a watch all the same.&#34;
b&#34;A very watchable film, and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing looks superb, from the ludicrous efforts of the effete upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity, to the lower class scum just trying to keep their heads above the filth, the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean extremely well, though the part does not exactly stretch him, and Robert Carlyle seems a little wasted on Plunkett, Miller&#39;s highwayman colleague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr Chance (a kind of 1740&#39;s chief of police) with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great film, and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of Peter Greenaway&#39;s films will love the look of this, although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth a viewing.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;m not sure if these other people saw the movie - some apparently couldn\&#39;t follow the &#34;complicated plot&#34;. He\&#39;s a billionaire who owns an oil company who ALSO happens to big game hunt - wow - that\&#39;s really far fetched. Any way - his new &#34;drilling machine&#34; happens to break through a glacier and on the other side is a world seperated from our own time where dinosaurs and cavemen wander around. Nothing ground breaking about this but it certainly isn\&#39;t ludicrous. Anyway the rest of the movie is about this T-Rex they find (which the billionaire, Boone, claimed was there) hunting them and them hunting it. Look - it\&#39;s an old made for TV movie - of course the special effects look cheesy - they didn\&#39;t have CG - they did the best they could and for a MFTVM they did a hell of a job for the time. This movie should be remade for the big screen - I\&#39;d love it and I\&#39;d be the first one in line. Seeing that Dinosaur with modern day special effects stalking those guys would be great!&#39;
b&#39;Like for most women this movie is the ultimate chick-flick. With it\&#39;s hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, i mean timeless classic like (I\&#39;ve Had) The Time of My Life &amp; the wonderful She\&#39;s Like The Wind makes this movie. I adore Patrick Swayze in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance it\&#39;s so hot. He sings &#34;She\&#39;s Like The Wind&#34; in the movie. The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Grey is amazing. I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. But saying this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great but Patrick Swayze scenes makes this. I love the songs, dancing and everything about it but it isn\&#39;t Dirty Dancing. Like I said it\&#39;s an amazing chick flick. Please let there be a 3rd because I love to see what happens with Patrick\&#39;s character Johnny. Jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey Patrick makes up for that if you know what I mean!!! Great movie and I\&#39;m so pleased Billy Zane didn\&#39;t win the movie role. I heard whispers he was meant for the role but they found out he couldn\&#39;t dance.&#39;
b&#39;I have seen this film at least 100 times and I am still excited by it, the acting is perfect and the romance between Joe and Jean keeps me on the edge of my seat, plus I still think Bryan Brown is the tops. Brilliant Film.&#39;
b&#39;Yes, this film has many gay characters. It also has straight characters, characters who are not sure about their sexuality, people who are searching for some truth about their existence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a film about sexual orientation. It\&#39;s about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another. Filmically, Denys Arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting, constantly shifting relationships. The serial killer element is a bit less successful (it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and, unlike the rest of the film, is thematically heavy-handed). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Gibson centers and grounds the film; it\&#39;s a quiet performance but behind the handsome, arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him. The supporting cast is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as Gibson\&#39;s friend, a dom-for-hire with precognitive powers. Her role is more metaphor than a literal conceit---strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, she represents the light and dark of the characters\&#39; sexual consciousness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film\&#39;s involving and often surprises in its character development. The effect is somewhat like Robert Altman directing a David Mamet script---the dialogue doesn\&#39;t shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning. Often, in our search for love and a conventional &#34;relationship&#34;, we ignore the love that already exists around us---in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are. Arcand and the writer, Brad Fraser, make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is a rewarding experience. It may not be for bigots who can\&#39;t get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater, transcendental message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. A film like this, that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye, deserves applause and an open-minded approach.&#39;
b&#34;I originally saw this on its premiere in the UK. I was mesmerised by it, and it had me in tears all throughout its duration. I taped it off the TV for safekeeping, but over the years, it&#39;s worn out. And TV never seem to show it. Therefore it was a joy to find out that True Movies own the copyright and were showing it on their channels. This time, I taped it onto a DVD, so I can enjoy it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucile Fray (played magnificently by Ann - Margret) discovers she has cancer, and that it is terminal. Her husband has arthritis, and, although he is loving, he is an alcoholic, and would be incapable of taking care of their children after she has gone. Therefore, she has to find new homes for each of her children before she dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is top notch, the music beautiful, and it has stood the test of time wonderfully (it still makes me cry!) If you ever get the chance, you would be silly to miss this. It is a wonderful film! A must see for everyone!!!&#34;
b&#34;Spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time. And as far as I know it&#39;s also the only one that focuses on the L.A. Punk Explosion of the early eighties. It&#39;s all there: not just great, great bands like Black Flag, Fear, X, the Germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today&#39;s alternative rock music can not be over-estimated, but also the promoters, the media and first of all the audiences - the punks - all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh, shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy, the anger and the fury these youths put into their music. Where is that today? The eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music, but the underground was rocking. If you need a proof for that, watch Fear&#39;s performance in Decline. Unmatched. Great film! How come this is not available on vid, LD or DVD? P.S. The follow-up Decline Pt. II is hilarious, too&#34;
b&#34;This is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired, or impaired in some other way... The acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional, and to let you know how bad the special effects are, there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet, moving it about. The movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder. When I saw this movie for the first time, a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and I were calling each other names from this flick, that&#39;s how terrible it was. If you enjoy getting mad at movies, I recommend this to you, otherwise, flee as though your very life depended on it.&#34;
b&#39;I remember seeing this film in the theater and liking it. I happened to stumble upon it on fear net last month and watched it again and found it better with age. First of all for those of you who describe this as 80s cheese if you objectively compare it with the horror flicks of the past 2 decades it compares quite well if stacked up against films in its unique horror sub genre which I would term action/horror as opposed to psychological horror such as &#34;The Shining&#34; or &#34;the exorcist&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore for its budget this film really delivers the goods (or in this instance bad). The film actually has some character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door. The film also has several hilarious one liners and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horror flick should have. If you compare NOD to contemporary big budget horror films such as &#34;I am legend&#34; (The Vincent Price version was much better) this film really stands out. Modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no plot or character devel at all and are completely predictable. The special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic. If this is 80s horror cheese I\&#39;ll take it over 95% of current entries in the genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a closing note seeing NOD again made me remember the beautiful Jill Terashita and wonder why I have not seen her in more films horror or otherwise. Jill on the odd chance that you read this- I think you are gorgeous and should have been in more films. Lastly, if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a lot.&#39;
b&#39;Out of any category, this is one demented and over the edge film, even in todays standards. Filmed entirely in crap-o-rama, this film will blow your mind (and something else too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is astonishing. The dialog is breathtakingly fast and campy. You\&#39;ll either love or hate this film, but give it go. I\&#39;ve seen it 4 times and absolutely love it. Divine is in the quest for being the filthiest person alive, but so are her rivals too in this obscene and disgusting (but funny) and stylish little film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divine was phenomenal, and &#34;she&#34; will always be missed greatly. Edith Massey does the unforgettable performance as the &#34;egglady&#34; and don\&#39;t forget the energetic Mink Stole!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\xc3\x9cber crazy s**t! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended also for you sick little puppies;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Female Trouble &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate Living &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polyester&#39;
b&#39;If you want to see a film with no guns, blood, sex, shouting angry people, hero, bad guys &amp; girls or even clumsy love words and you want to see a film in which every shot has the meaning of &#34;LOVE&#34; , this one is a must see film. For me I\&#39;ve been waiting for a film like this all of my life.&#39;
b&#39;Unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by Joseph Mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by AIDS and his new young neighbor, a wanna-be tough redneck played to perfection by Brad Renfro. Although the story may seem slightly farfetched (the two boys attempt to river-raft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to AIDS), the emotion, actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life. Being a &#34;big brother&#34; to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released, I strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with AIDS. Superb direction by Peter Horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity.&#39;
b&#39;Things that are only just now &#34;news&#34; were taken as a given in this shocking documentary. I fear that as the investigation proceeds, the producers of this film will be vindicated in spades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The producers show us the Davidians, the government agents, the investigators, with all their faults and all their humanity. Nothing any reviewer can say could approach the impact of watching and listening for yourself. Pieces of evidence -- Congressional testimony, 911 tapes, news footage, expert commentary, interviews, photos and home videos -- are seamlessly woven together and tell a disturbing tale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not wait. See this film and tell your friends.&#39;
b&#34;Twins Effect, starring some of HK&#39;s most popular stars provides one of the most enjoyable film experiences to come out of HK in sometime. It has something for everyone, action, comedy, horror, romance, and some drama. This film can&#39;t be taken too seriously, otherwise you&#39;d go in dissapointed, but if you leave your brain at the door, and just watch the film for some fun, you&#39;re bound to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great special effects, excellent action, cute Twins, cool HK actors, FUN film!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d recommend it to anyone!&#34;
b&#39;&#34;What\&#39;s his name?&#34; &#34;Loudon.&#34; &#34;Loudon what?&#34; &#34;Clear.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That gag still gets me, TWENTY ONE years after the film was released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the film back then and I love it today. I must have watched this a hundred times back in the day, and when I bought the DVD recently I could still remember some of the dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman jailed for a crime she didn\&#39;t commit. When she gets out she decides to seek revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffin Dunne (whatever happened to him?), plays an attorney for his fianc\xc3\xa9e\&#39;s father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposed new public relations programme. A seemingly easy task, but there are complications aplenty, some funny dialogue, and some admittedly stupid-but-funny scenes along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madonna has a stupid voice in this film, which until I was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me (hence only 8/10), but on the other hand I can\&#39;t imagine her doing it in her normal voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film shows Madonna\&#39;s comic side (too lacking these days, perhaps), and she genuinely is funny in the role. Dunne makes a great foil, while Haviland Morris is perfect as the uppity fianc\xc3\xa9e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it\&#39;s predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more.&#39;
b&#34;Being Cornish and brought up with the history of tin mining, this film is quite special to me. Filmed in and around various locations in Cornwall, it depicts the story of two your children who get trapped down a mine with a group of miners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#39;Haunters&#39; of the title refers to the &#39;Spriggins&#39; - ghosts of child miners who reside in the mine and are said to bring evil to all that mine there. Events take place with an American wanting to invest in local tin mining, but when the young local kid Josh is plagued by sightings of the ghost of a young boy, he and his American &#39;girlfriend&#39; set out to unravel the mystery behind his death, climaxing in the rescue of themselves and several miners from almost certain death when a new shaft is opened and the Spiggins save them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top film, albeit low budget and short, but worth a look if you&#39;re from Cornwall and/or into tin mining!&#34;
b&#39;Here\&#39;s one of the more pleasingly scuzzy 70\&#39;s blaxploitation grindhouse items; it\&#39;s a pervasively low-rent pimp opus which comes across like a sleazier version of &#34;The Mack.&#34; John Daniels, the studly womanizing hairdresser hero Mr. Jonathan in the immortal &#34;Black Shampoo,&#34; gives an excellent steely portrayal of the Baron, a ruthless, business savvy, forever on the make all-powerful flesh peddler who much to the dismay of his bitter, brutal Italian rivals reigns supreme over the Sunset Strip. When not locking horns with his fellow no-count criminal pals or doing his best to avoid being busted by the local vice cops, Daniels is leading a sweetly average existence as your standard garden-variety suburbanite dude (complete with caring wife and loving kids!) in some typically humdrum California small town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glaringly absurd premise alone promises top-rate trashy greatness of a decidedly Grade B schlock picture variety (George Theakos deserves kudos for his hilariously ludicrous script). Matt Cimber\&#39;s commendably tactless and tasteless direction delivers the junky goods by the slimy bucketful, thus making this film a hugely enjoyable serving of celluloid grime. Among the assorted squalid delights to be savored herein are plentiful gratuitous female nudity, coarse dialogue, beautifully gaudy Me Decade threads (halter tops, felt hats, sparkling Day-Glo jewelry, loud seersucker suits), an intensely funky R&amp;B score by Smoke, some hopelessly pathetic acting (the little old lady who lives next door to Daniels is excruciatingly shrill), a memorably nasty turn by Patrick Wright as a sadistic goon, a couple of cool action set pieces (the climactic slow motion barroom massacre seriously cooks), more lurid travelogue footage of the Sunset Strip than you can shake a feather boa at (said footage allegedly includes &#34;the actual hookers and blades of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood&#34;), effectively dark\&#39;n\&#39;dingy cinematography by Ken Gibb, a few sicko sexual fetish tableaux, some raw explicit violence (a prostitute has one of her breasts cut off!), and amusing supporting performances by familiar schlock feature perennials Richard Kennedy and George &#34;Buck&#34; Flower as a pair of racist, corrupt, browbeating police detectives. Sure, this movie ain\&#39;t art, but it\&#39;s certainly artless enough to qualify as a deliciously grungy chunk of entertainingly sordid cinematic swill.&#39;
b&#39;I saw this movie years ago and I never forgot it. The theme is very timely. It was on TCM this morning and I am wondering why this wonderful film is not on VHS or DVD. I have searched extensively for this movie but cannot find it. I believe that if enough people request it, the movie will ultimately be put on DVD. It amazes me that such a stunning performance from Quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must see for teachers and students alike. This film is a great teaching tool from the past yet in many ways as contemporary as &#34;Crash&#34;. From previous comments I can see that this film as made deep impressions on everyone. Again, too bad it is not available for sale.&#39;
b&#39;Passion In The Desert exemplifies spatial grander. It is a visual narrative, illuminated by the magnificent cinematography. Passion was filmed on location in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia, and Tunisia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are in Egypt, 1798. Augustin, a Napoleanic soldier, is escorting writer and artist Jean-Michel Venture De Paradis on an official mission to document, measure, draw, and paint the cultural landmarks of the Egypt: its dunes, stupendous ruins, and mysterious people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, can you truly &#34;document&#34; majestic sandscapes, fractured edifices, and wild Bedouins? Can you truly capture the essence of Egypt, nature, man, and time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean and Augustin become lost in the mesmerizing glittering, gold desert, whose vastness overwhelms their senses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;You can\&#39;t get lost in Egypt! There\&#39;s the Nile, and there\&#39;s the sea!&#34;, says the dehydrated Augustin, and soon he discovers an ancient, winding cave that leads to a palatial ruin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delirious and near-delusional, he attempts to rest; a perplexing sound rouses him; his eyes, body, and emotions become hypnotically locked in time as he stumbles into a sensual, sensory experience.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wild, sleek female leopard stares back at him, and their love affair begins....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A daring love affair, a daring film.&#39;
b&#39;Ann-Margret did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making. I felt as if she WAS Mrs. Frey. There might be one or two films of Ann-Margret\&#39;s I have not seen since her film debut in &#34;Pocket full of Miracles&#34; with Betty Davis in 1961. I feel she has been totally under-rated in the industry. Though she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in &#34;Who Will Love My Children,&#34; she was overlooked. Like she was nominated for an Academy Award for her roles in &#34;Carnal Knowledge&#34; and &#34;Tommy,&#34; she was snubbed. Over all, I think everyone did a superb acting job including all the children in &#34;Who Will Love My Children.&#34; Yes, it is a sad movie (as true stories can be), but well worth the time. Thank you.&#39;
b&#39;As social satire, Idiocracy is just as good as Office Space, but with a wider scope. To criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point, I think. There are certainly fart jokes etc., but they\&#39;re not really intended to be funny to the audience - they exist to define the state of &#34;culture&#34; in the world of 2500 AD visited by Joe, as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes. The real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives, and which should serve as a warning. My personal favorite is the depiction of Fox News. The subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at &#34;smart&#34; people, and average Joes like the protagonists. Note the times in the film when Joe and Rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them, and you realize that Idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular, but on the culture of idiocy in general. I don\&#39;t know what to say about the &#34;made for conspiracy theory&#34; behavior of Fox in releasing this film, but if it\&#39;s not playing in your local theater, demand it. We all need to see this film, if not for the social commentary, at least for the fart jokes...&#39;
b&#39;Ah, Batman Returns, is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! We have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he\&#39;s still awesome than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn\&#39;t have been Catwoman, she doesn\&#39;t really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just great and terrifying! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, they are celebrating Christmas time with, Max Shrek played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to make him loved in Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! But there is also another active villain, The Penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You\&#39;ll have to see! Batman Returns is just as good as the original Batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean we\&#39;ve got Michelle in leather! Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin &#34;Meow&#34; is classic! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets! You\&#39;ll have a blast! Trust me! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10&#39;
b&#39;The Kite Runner should win an Oscar! It\&#39;s perfect in every sense, the story, the script, the acting, the cinematography... One would never guess it was filmed in China. The story of two childhood friends and what follows in their adult lives will leave a lasting impression. The depiction of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban is all too real and horrifying. I have not read the book, but I have seen comments that put down the movie because &#34;the book is always better&#34;... It doesn\&#39;t really matter. No one put down &#34;Gone With The Wind&#34; because it wasn\&#39;t true to the book! As a matter of fact, it won the Academy Award for best picture and several other Oscars. I think this movie is brilliant - BRAVO to the writer and director, and the actors!&#39;
b&#34;Sean Bean returns as Napoleonic hero Richard Sharpe in Sharpe&#39;s Honour, the fifth movie in the series and as always Patrick Harper and the rest of Sharpes chosen men are all along for the ride, but this time Major Sharpe is in serious trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the influence of Sharpe&#39;s sworn enemy Major Ducos, a mysterious lady by the name of La Marquesa has accused Sharpe of rape. Her husband arrives at Sharpe&#39;s camp to challenge his wife&#39;s attacker to a dual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dual is discovered and stopped by the authorities, and as a result Sharpe becomes the prime suspect when his opponent is murdered in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As no-one in the British Army other than Wellington and Major Nairn consider Sharpe anything but a rough commoner with little or no honour, he his given a shambolic trial and is sentenced to death by hanging, and Harper and the chosen men have no choice but to look on as their beloved commander walks slowly to the gallows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, convinced of his innocence Wellington and Nairn hang another convicted prisoner in Sharpe&#39;s stead and release him and his chosen men to find the real killer and La Marquesa herself, to not only prove his innocence but to find out her reasons for framing him in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daragh O&#39;Malley, Micheal Byrne and Hugh Fraser co-star with brilliant performances by Alice Krige as La Marquesa and F\xc3\xa9odor Atkine as the villainous Major Ducos, in what is another exciting, swashbuckling instalment through Sharpe&#39;s eventful journey through the Napoleonic Wars.&#34;
b&#39;As an ex Merchant Seaman I was really interested in this movie : I personally have been involved in a stowaway search on leaving Kingston Jamaica where one person was found. We managed to get him ashore though as we were in territorial limits. On another ship I was on the stowaway was found and we could not land him anywhere due to passport/nationality issues. In fact he stayed on for a year as an almost &#34;honorary&#34; crew member and worked for his keep. Africa is notorious for stowaway pickups. There is a great scene in the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the African port : her size dwarfing all. The crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation. So far normal. The drama starts when the stowaways enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship. Joss Ackland is brilliant as the Captain with a drink problem being harassed by his Nemesis Suchet right on form as the Companys representative on board. The stowaway search is classic but we did not have guns. I question the use of guns in this film. This ship seemed to have a vast armoury. In my experience guns at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations., also having a dog on board was odd.Anti Rabies laws especially in Europe restrict carrying of animal severely. Anyway Pertwee is brilliant as the embittered Mate. The horror which follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable : the grim metallic background of the ships holds and a feeling that there is no where to hide adds to the drama.Some of the freighters crew are not into the murder and those who get involved are gradually sucked in to a world of violence from which there is no escape.The chase through the ship especially the engine room scenes are &#34;edge on the seat&#34; : the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds. The feeling of metal pressing in and death being only a gun barrel away. The film is brutal : my girlfriend had to give up watching it during the shooting and beating scenes. While this goes on Suchet in the comfort of his well appointed cabin gets drunk unaware of the mayhem 3 decks below. Its a tense film, flawed in parts but the real message is that we can all get sucked into violence like this. Slowly and surely. Think of the train drivers who took Jews to Auschwitz, the clerks who worked out those train timetable. I always remember someone who had visited Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and he said that one of the S.S. Guards had put a bird-table outside the camp crematorium. This film is like that : ordinary people suddenly finding themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!&#39;
b&#39;i loved catcher in the rye, it happens to be my favorite book. JD salinger, the author of catcher, has the rights to the book and made it so not one person can make a movie about it with his permission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with that said, heres &#34;united states of Leland.&#34; Beautiful movie with much meaning and depth in emotion. but a lot of it reminded me of catcher, almost too much reminded me of catcher. the few stories that Leland told in the movie such as visiting new york and his adventures were very similar to those of holden\&#39;s in catcher, and the way Leland views people and emotions is also similar to Holden\&#39;s, they both are simple and true to themselves and others. superior acting credited to don cheadle and Kevin spacy. great editing, all falls together perfectly, and loved the story all together. recommend as a buy or at least a rent. good movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that it does drag at some points but makes up for it in the long run. give it time and appreciate a good movie.&#39;
b&#34;Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then to the current movie. When Ray Charles was little, he went blind and his mother didn&#39;t baby him. She was a strong woman who didn&#39;t treat him any different because he was blind. She made him do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later on in life. His mother also sent him to school as well. Then when Ray Charles became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself but there was a downfall into narcotics, sex and betrayal. When I am discouraged about something I can just think of this movie and it will inspire me.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;m an action movie fan but until today I\&#39;ve never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in Italy, so I went to see &#34;The Long Kiss Goodnight&#34; on pay-TV hoping for nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funny action movie ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The transformation of Samantha/Charly from ordinary wife-teacher to cool-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. The action scenes and the stunts are the best I\&#39;ve ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best lines I have ever heard and his chemistry with Geena Davis is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what about Geena? She is wonderful, she plays the best action heroine ever seen and does strong, convincing acting and fantastic stunts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female lead roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10.&#39;
b&#39;I can\&#39;t say I enjoyed this as much as &#34;The Big Lebowski&#34; or &#34;Raising Arizona,&#34; and felt a little slighted, but &#34;O Brother&#34; is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the Coens\&#39; brisk, twisted sense of creativity. The DVD edition contains the featurette, and I was interested to find out that the Coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques. That surprised me! Of course, this movie is not the best example (and I\&#39;m only saying this in comparison) and it wasn\&#39;t worthy of any Oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I enjoyed the Coens\&#39; previous work, I\&#39;ve never been a fan of old westerns or &#34;The Dukes of Hazzard&#34; or any of that stuff they show daily on TNN. I guess that\&#39;s why I didn\&#39;t feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie, seeing that it revolves around Southern folk. For all those from the South who are reading this, I don\&#39;t mean to offend ANY of your people! I\&#39;m sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like &#34;A Bronx Tale.&#34; When you live in the city all your life, it\&#39;s hard to get accustomed to films of this nature. But all apologies aside, I found the characters fun and quirky. I think John Turturro nailed the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life I find that amazing. Tim Blake Nelson was also good. Of course, George Clooney--who I assume is not the best at feigning accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for &#34;The Perfect Storm&#34;--naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent. His performance was good, though. You can also spot Coen regulars like Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also on screen for a short time, but steals every minute of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I don\&#39;t normally dig country music, I liked the title song &#34;A Man of Constant Sorrow.&#34; The DVD also contains the music video for that song. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found the film entertaining and original, but it doesn\&#39;t have that in-your-face quality that the Coens have shown to us in the past. It\&#39;s a slighter effort, but a good one. I still suggest you check it out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My score: 7 (out of 10)&#39;
b&#39;Since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline, I won\&#39;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I\&#39;d like to restate that Bardem\&#39;s interpretation is terrific, as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the previous comments I\&#39;ve noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesn\&#39;t show points of view opposed to euthanasia and that those little present are ridiculed. In my honest opinion this is far from true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving Ram\xc3\xb3n Sampedro and wanting him to stay, and understanding his desire to die. Most obvious of those are the family. For instance, Ram\xc3\xb3n\&#39;s sister-in-law never talks for or against euthanasia. Another such character is Gen\xc3\xa9 (the social rights activist) who, in the last moment, tells Ram\xc3\xb3n to re-think it all. The scene clearly shows that she doesn\&#39;t want him to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia. Ram\xc3\xb3n\&#39;s brother is clearly against it, as is his father (&#34;There\&#39;s only one thing worse than the death of son, and it\&#39;s having a son that wants to die.&#34;) Other users have commented that the discussion between Ram\xc3\xb3n and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ram\xc3\xb3n is GOOD and the priest is BAD. Well, no doubt the scene is comic, but that doesn\&#39;t mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince Ram\xc3\xb3n to keep on living using arguments totally alien to Ram\xc3\xb3n\&#39;s thinking. The priest\&#39;s speech goes on the line of &#34;God gives and God takes&#34;, &#34;We aren\&#39;t the owners of our own lives, they belong to God&#34;... and so on. The comedy arises from the fact that Ram\xc3\xb3n is atheist and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is the antithesis of manicheism, it leaves the spectator the chance to think on the subject and make up his/her own opinion. And above anything else is a chant of FREEDOM.&#39;
b&#34;This movie is one of the funniest I have seen in years. A movie which deals with death and funerals without being depressing, or irreverant. Christopher Walken provides much of the comedy in this charming romance and I could hardly breathe for laughing so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the movie a preview, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded, but cheered. I am telling all my friends to watch for it&#39;s arrival in the USA. I definitely plan on seeing it again in the theater and purchasing it on DVD as soon as it&#39;s available.&#34;
b&#34;Greystoke is without doubt the best tarzan movie I have ever seen. Christopher Lambert portrays a very believable man trying to return to the world of mankind alongside the fantastic Ian Holm. The struggle of John to leave the jungle and the apes who raised him is quite stirring. Some very memorable scenes including where Lambert makes the jungle noises to the romantic interest, and the scene where he witnesses his ape father&#39;s death. Tarzans feelings for both worlds is well developed and really makes you feel for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent and underrated movie.&#34;
b&#34;There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner&#39;s face; he figures she really can&#39;t sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen&#39;s amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take. Nicely done! For some reason, I have never forgotten that scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Karen Carpenter Story chronicles the meteoric rise of the Carpenters, and Karen&#39;s struggle to overcome anorexia. A lot of things are glossed over. This isn&#39;t a documentary, and the movie left me with a lot of questions. Very little is mentioned of Karen&#39;s solo venture (the CD was released only a few years ago. If you buy it, you will wonder why they waited. It&#39;s some of Karen&#39;s best work. The songs aren&#39;t as timeless as her work with brother Richard, but it was a great recording, in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard it said that, you can be listening to a cheap, time-worn little radio in the middle of the Third World, that would seem to produce more static than anything else. But when a Carpenter song comes on the radio, you would think you were listening to a $1000 Hi-Fidelity unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch this movie!&#34;
b&#34;I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera&#39;s Eve watching an amazing drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. Several years later we see Amudha, a playful well-loved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence. On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not their biological child, she was adopted. This tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her. Several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother. The country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess. But this also leads to their meeting the new Shyama - one who finally is confronted by Amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother, the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons that drive the birth mother, the normalcy of Chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring. AR Rahman&#39;s music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film. The film has excellent performances from Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolute stunner role as Amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste P. S. Keerthana. This performance won her a National award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot. I am intrigued by the connection Mani Ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. I think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding. Mahadevan&#39;s character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl. His one liners were hilarious. The mother played by Simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids. The shock, angst, and obsession of the child Amudha was outstandingly portrayed by P. S. Keerthana. Her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking. In fact the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das, and her husband. Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. It also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - I rarely weep in the movies, but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick. This is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film!&#34;
b&#34;Okay, I&#39;m not sure if this counts as a spoiler so i just ticked the box anyway to save the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that the opinions on this film seem to be a fair split. Personally, i loved it, although i must say that i think that some of the cameo&#39;s were there for the sake of having a cameo. (Peter Kay?) Personally, i am just thankful that it wasn&#39;t the Edward, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou show, and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to headline the motion picture, especially Sir Goeff Tipps arguably the funniest of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, this is less of a Summary more of a fairly obtuse blog-like thing, but what the hell, the film was awesome, and i guess that&#39;s all that counts.&#34;
b&#39;Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the great actor\&#39;s anti-Nazi propaganda piece, skewering Adolf Hitler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber who is Hynckel\&#39;s spitting image. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen newsreels of Hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical Chaplin slap-stick focussing on the First World War adventures of the Jewish barber. Having never seen it before I must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so I was wondering what all the fuss was about. But the movie picks up steam quickly. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of &#34;Hynckel-ism&#34; to make the propaganda point. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As good as Chaplin is in this movie, though, I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack Oakie, playing the dictator of &#34;Bacteria&#34; - &#34;Benzino Napaloni.&#34; Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had Mussolini\&#39;s arrogant posturing down pat. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate over the fate of &#34;Osterlich&#34; had me in stitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a very good movie, and well worth watching.&#39;
b&#39;The movie &#34;Everything is Illuminated&#34; comes from first-time writer-director Liev Schreiber, adapting Jonathan Safran Foer\&#39;s first novel. The book was ambitious and sprawling, its magical-realist elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen. The movie, wisely, attempts less. While the end result is not as wildly original as the novel, it\&#39;s still an accomplished movie about a strange Eastern European road trip, or, as one of the characters would have it, &#34;a very rigid search.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian man who loves American pop culture but can\&#39;t seem to get the English language straight. Nevertheless, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a tour company catering to American Jews, convinces him to serve as a translator for Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan is investigating his family history, and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. More than one family secret gets revealed during their quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie\&#39;s Jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi- kleptomaniacal weirdo who steals his own grandmother\&#39;s dentures to add to his collection of &#34;family things&#34;. Wood\&#39;s quiet, wide-eyed, earnest manner works very well in this role. Hutz makes an impressive debut as the loose-limbed, easygoing Alex. His malapropisms are hilarious, but he is also able to pull off the character\&#39;s growing self-awareness. The dog Mikki is very funny as the demented Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., and one of the few movie dogs I\&#39;ve ever seen that isn\&#39;t cloyingly cute and precocious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Everything is Illuminated&#34; eventually puts the Holocaust on a human scale, asking us to remember it not as a general event, but as millions of specific, small tragedies. Reminiscent of a European movie, it also ponders the effect of past events on present-day young people like Jonathan and Alex. With its original perspective, strong performances and some very striking visuals, &#34;Everything is Illuminated&#34; is great work for a first-timer, and hopefully Schreiber will continue to direct movies.&#39;
b&#34;Hoot was terrific. The owls are adorable and the movie highlights an interesting environmental issue I didn&#39;t know existed. Florida is full of so many fun characters and the film does a great job of bringing that to the screen. My kids particularly loved all the different animals, from snakes, to owls to alligators. It&#39;s really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. When kids are young that&#39;s when they really develop their sense of values, and yes one of those must be caring for our environment and all the creatures that live in it. I think it was great that the film even sparked a conversation with them on the ride home about animals and how to help them. It was just truly sweet and enduring to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the baby birds. Anyway, overall it was really a great time and I&#39;d recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining AND meaningful.&#34;
b&#39;When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I\&#39;m happy. I\&#39;m watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the &#34;benefit&#34; of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem. Producers and network suits need to turn to the Travis Davis\&#39; out there for material and stop awarding deals to people simply because their resume or agent may demand they should. Boy-Next-Door has, hopefully, gained the attention of the right people to facilitate more work from Davis. It\&#39;s really fun and very well done!&#39;
b&#39;Twenty years after watching this, I still find myself quoting things from this movie like &#34;Look between the two giant melons&#34;, or I\&#39;ll start to sing the &#34;Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme&#34;. On the other hand, 20 years later, I can now make sense of the &#34;Meat Machine&#34;, as there\&#39;s still a lot of the stereotypes like this out there that they used for this movie. Those are signs of a good movie to me. I could say this movie stands the test of time, which I can\&#39;t really say for a lot of 80\&#39;s movies. I continue that this movie is still on a list of a lot of people\&#39;s favorite movie as a kid growing up in the 80\&#39;s. If you like games, and have dreams of becoming a &#34;Game Master&#34;, or find yourself dorking out over these 80\&#39;s movies to relive your childhood, you need to watch this. Also, it\&#39;s sometimes sarcastic, and funny. But one thing\&#39;s for certain about this movie, if someone ever invites you to a &#34;Great All-Nighter&#34; they don\&#39;t mean an X or acid trip party, they mean, get ready for some Midnight Madness! Oh, You\&#39;ll see. Everyone will be dying to play! hehehehheh.&#39;
b&#34;Not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece. this film contains a myriad of messages that all should take to heart. especially- women do not squelch your man&#39;s dreams -honor them -that&#39;s why you loved him in the first place! Those who plan for death will live in the grave. Those who carpe diem will awaken those who live in fear. Even our Lord spoke of this when he chastised the the one who buried his talent in fear that he might make a mistake and displease the Master. Take a risk, get out of the boat and you will walk on water. Life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls.&#34;
b&#34;A proof that it&#39;s not necessary for a movie to have a deep many-layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. Even if the story could be expanded in many directions, especially in more sociological way (people lust for money) it seems that it&#39;s perfect just the way it is. Through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the acting for me isn&#39;t so good. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon the others were average or even worst. In some scenes they just empty-stared in front of themselves. For exception of Lindsey which was more convincing. It&#39;s a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#34;
b&#39;While watching a mundane modern movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (age 22) she asked me &#34;Since you\&#39;ve been watching movies since 1938, what is the greatest movie of your lifetime?&#34; Boy! What a choice that is! It took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before I made my decision. It is &#34;THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES&#34;. This movie has no flaws. It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story. There is not a single part in the film which could be left out. The young girl\&#39;s fixation with her brothers lack of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsiblity was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action. A women who must now adjust to the husband who\&#39;s life has been away from her for years. The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands. A parents first look and reaction to their son\&#39;s new deformities. A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank\&#39;s loan structure. This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed any different. This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will ever see. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it compulsory for anyone taking history, film making, creative writing, sociology, family counciling or psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers art.&#39;
b&#39;This is one of the best of the early &#34;Star Trek&#34; episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the &#34;Star Trek&#34; universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of war-time paranoia is all too real. Then there\&#39;s the Romulans: they\&#39;re the ultimate Federation nemesis. The Klingons are nasty but basically harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, mean business: they\&#39;re the ancient Romans reborn in the space age; in spite of their Vulcanoid features they\&#39;re clearly meant to remind us of imperial Rome, with names like Decius and titles like &#34;centurion&#34; and &#34;praetor.&#34; The chain-mail armor is really cool. Familiar guest star Mark Lenard, who went on to play Spock\&#39;s dad Sorek as well as the Klingon commander in &#34;Star Trek: the Motion Picture&#34; is an appropriately grizzled, war-weary commander, a character who bears a striking resemblance to Laurence Olivier\&#39;s Crassus in &#34;Spartacus.&#34; Also, his questioning of the Empire\&#39;s unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar misgivings Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) expressed at the beginning of &#34;Gladiator.&#34; A must both for Trekkies and sword-and-sandal epic fans.&#39;
b&#34;Alright, so maybe the impersonations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not spot on, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellant as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie doesn&#39;t go for joke and punchline but it is still funny. Kathy Bates in particular is amazing as Leno&#39;s manager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, amazing, interesting, very watchable, this is a good TV movie.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;ve been waiting since last October to see this film! (it was supposed to come out October \&#39;98) and now I\&#39;ve finally seen it I am not disappointed. Bloody marvellous! OK it was a tad slow in the beginning, but once it got going it\&#39;s a very exciting nail-biting tense Robert Carlyle is so different from either Gaz in \&#39;The Full Monty\&#39; and Begbie in \&#39;Trainspotting\&#39; ) that it\&#39;s hard to recognise him! And Johnny Lee Miller, no longer with his Sick Boy from \&#39;Trainspotting\&#39; blond hair, plays his dashing gentlemen highway man with the right about of humour and sensitivity that it is easy to see why Liv Tylers Rebecca falls for him. A great film. As Hades in Disney\&#39;s \&#39;Hercules\&#39; would say: &#34;Two thumbs way way up!!&#34;&#39;
b&#39;This is simply a good ole fashioned western..not overly complex or long. It doesn\&#39;t deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment. Still, it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning. It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford\&#39;s Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals Scott\&#39;s Sheriff Steve Upton\&#39;s horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving). In Red valley, Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead. Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta, a friend of Cheyenne\&#39;s who gives he and buddy &#34;Nitro&#34;(Guinn \&#39;Big Boy\&#39; Williams)a place to stay for the time being. Cheyenne desires to go straight, but finds that hard when Jack Lester(Bernard Nedell)and his bad bunch want to rob Red Valley\&#39;s bank. It is actually Jack who is behind the murders, but Cheyenne\&#39;s troubled past is hard to get away from. He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they didn\&#39;t commit(the robbery was one Cheyenne didn\&#39;t commit)and it will be Upton who must somehow save the day before Lester gets away with murder. There are sub-plots which include Cheyenne\&#39;s falling in love with Alison McLeod{Evelyn Keyes;the irony of the story is that Alison\&#39;s father, Uncle Willie, is actually in cahoots with Banker Stanley Clanton(Porter Hall)in a planned united theft with Lester to steal the town of Red Valley\&#39;s loot}. Will Upton uncover Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton\&#39;s treacherous scheme? Will Uncle Willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him? This film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout. Columbia couldn\&#39;t have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such. Don\&#39;t expect to get your socks blown off, but the film is simple and well paced.&#39;
b&#39;I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous Karate Kid installments. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike the previous versions, the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path, rather than a male teenager. Maggi finds this a little more challenging, but rises to the occasion. The plot twists are believable and predictable. I found that the bad guys are a little one dimensional, but this weakness is present in all the installments in varying degrees. The camera work is impressive and pans across some beautiful scenery from time to time. The Zen monastery is both austere and charming. The Zen monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the &#34;Zen Bowling&#34; scenes which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious Zen archery scene earlier on. The quality level of the movie is like a good TV series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band playing &#34;Listen to Your Heart&#34;. The lessons in the movie are valuable and worthwhile to learn. They feel faithful to the spirit of karate and take care not to over-glorify the fighting part. All in all, I enjoyed it.&#39;
b&#34;This film has to be as near to perfect a film as John Ford made. The film is magic, a masterpiece, the reason Ford was, well Ford. If you want to know why Ford was great this one explains it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photography of course is superb, black and white as black and white should be, wonderful shots, not an over the shoulder conversation in it, pure Ford, great moments, big and little. The famous ripped pants of Ward Bond. Apparently two dogs kept invading the set and fighting so Ford wanted to use them in the fighting scene, but instead of fighting one dog ran away and the other attacked Ward Bond and ripped his pants, which caused Ford no end of mirth. A whole scene around plaiting a rope. The way Ben Johnson burn then snuffs his rope, wonderful foreshadowing and anticipation of the final. Harry Carey&#39;s naive courting of Prudence. The usual ford line about being scared and not showing it. Bond&#39;s horse accidentally falling in him and its left in the film. Johnson and Bond are fantastic in that scene. Lord help any Ford actor who does not stay in character while the camera is rolling even when a horse falls on top of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of very sweet romances, not intruding on the whole focus, two very likable leads, not to mention for the girls, the number of times the cameras focus on Ben Johnson&#39;s rather delightful backside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of old time stuntmen getting lines and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Some wonderful character studies mostly of faces staring, all the villains and main stars. A set of villains to rival any group in any western.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many many Fordian shots of faces, groups, children, women, small things happening, foals in the background (Ford seems to love images of foals), women in aprons, allowing the moment as wagons cross rivers and the camera lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably not a western as much as an artist&#39;s picture that happens to be set in the west.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky the film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine such a film could be ever made again, but then it is such a work of art that it would be a sacrilege to attempt it&#34;
b&#34;The movie Haggard is one of the funniest movies of all time. It features the cast from CKY (the movies) and also has a GREAT soundtrack. If you have seen any CKY or Viva La Bam you will notice that everybody (from those two) are in it. Including Bam&#39;s parents and many other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about Ryan Dunn&#39;s girlfriend Glauren (Jennifer Rivall) cheating on him, and him trying to get back at her. He does this by having Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo) vandalize her house. There are many different characters with many different stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is great music on the soundtrack. Bands such as Him &amp; Her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and the Stooges Pop, and New Order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not like Viva La Bam or CKY (the movies) I doubt you will like this. If you DO like that stuff...this movie is great.&#34;
b&#34;DRIVING LESSONS is a little film that sneaks up on you. What at first seems to be a bit of fluffy nonsense comedy British style is at its base a very fine story about coming of age and the needs for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly. Writer Jeremy Brock (&#39;Mrs. Brown&#39;, &#39;Charlotte Gray&#39;, &#39;The Last King of Scotland&#39;) here directs his own screenplay and the result is a cohesive, progressively involving tale filled with fascinating and diverse characters, each performed by sterling actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, standing firmly on his own as a developing actor post &#39;Harry Potter&#39; series) is a quiet, plain little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching Vicar father (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive, rigid, evangelical do-gooder mother (Laura Linney) in a home where &#39;needy people&#39;, such as the murderous cross-dressing Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton), take precedence over family matters: the mother is by the way having an affair with priest Peter (Oliver Milburn), using Ben as her cover! Sad Ben is among other things attempting to learn to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides he needs professional lessons AND needs to get a job to help pay for poor Mr. Fincham&#39;s needs. Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly has-been actress who is as zany as any character ever created. She hires Ben and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents, including a camping trip Evie demands they take, the two learn life&#39;s lessons missing from each other&#39;s natures: Ben learns self respect and self confidence and Evie finds a true friend who will allow her to drop her stagy facade and be the dear human being she has been hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie Walters, always offering the finest skills of acting in every character she creates, finds a role like no other here: she is outlandishly wild and lovable. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age Ben. The chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film &#39;Harold and Maude&#39;. Laura Linney is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire. And the supporting cast is a panorama of fine characterizations. This film is a delightful surprise and one sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and acting - and message! Grady Harp&#34;
b&#39;We just saw this film previewed before release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two matters: There were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. What\&#39;s sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too &#34;heavy&#34; for them, while the people who would really enjoy it wouldn\&#39;t be caught dead walking into the theater showing it. Too bad. A good film wasted.&#39;
b&#34;The title is a reference to the destruction of the remnants of a harvest, like rice husks, by farmers who burn them creating fires on the plains. This is a bleak tale of the destruction of the Japanese soldier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is set in the closing days of the Philippines campaign as a soldier with TB who returns from a hospital because since he can walk, they have no room for him. His superior officers don&#39;t want him around since he&#39;s really too sick to work or fight. Abused by his officer he&#39;s sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or kill himself. They still won&#39;t take him and he&#39;s soon left to wander across the war ravaged landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food. Its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and man&#39;s inhumanity to man at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billed as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war this is also a very funny movie. This isn&#39;t to say its not horrifying, it is at times, but its also darkly comic. How could it not be? Here is a film where madness and insanity run rampant, people are constantly trying to hustle tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to remain a Japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by marching constantly but never getting anywhere and you can&#39;t help but laugh. To be sure things go darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism maybe, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny about the human comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hailed as a great anti-war film its stark photographic style makes clear the insanity of war even as it dazzles our eye with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian. set amid fields forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still are, quite beautiful. Its a jarring sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What intriguing is that I read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of Christianity. The director removed all over the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it as to show that life stinks, war stinks worse and that there is, ultimately no hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intellectually I admire the film, emotionally I don&#39;t. Part of it is a strident downbeat score which, for me over accentuates what we are seeing on the screen. Its almost gilding the lily since the imagery is so strong it doesn&#39;t really need to have the music force you into feeling one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a great film, thats for you to decide. For certain its unlike any other war film, bloody, horrific and real in ways that big budgeted films claim to be but never are. This is not for those adverse to blood and gore since its here in spades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a look.&#34;
b&#34;Okay, so I don&#39;t understand why people are getting so aggravated over this movie. So I thought it was going to be the usual Amanda Bynes movie, but it wasn&#39;t. It was GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, okay, so the acting wasn&#39;t the best, but I thought the performances were still overall great. Also, you could tell that the actors were having fun while doing this movie. In other movies, that have surprisingly won awards, where the actors didn&#39;t like working on the film, you could tell. All of the actors had chemistry, and that also showed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A ton of people are ripping on the soccer skills that the actors have. Yah, so they&#39;re not perfect...get over it! They are actors, not soccer players. I have been playing soccer for my whole life, and trust me, it is hard to learn, so stop ripping on the level of skills they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this movie was going to be stupid, but it was really funny. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a situation funny without even saying anything is funny. I found myself laughing a lot in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall..I LOVE IT!&#34;
b&#39;I would like to say that I absolutely loved Campfire Tales! To me, it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted ending. As if the contents of the movie weren\&#39;t scary or weird enough, you have the ending. It\&#39;s a very awesome movie and I\&#39;m so happy that it\&#39;s being released on DVD on August 30th.I will not hesitate to get my copy on that day.I don\&#39;t think the movie received all the credit or recognition it should have, because all these other movies came out shortly after and was acknowledge, but if it weren\&#39;t for my brother telling me about the movie, I wouldn\&#39;t have known. Which stinks because in my opinion it\&#39;s far better than any &#34;Scream&#34;, &#34;I know what you did Last Summer&#34;, or any other horror for that time. So I hope that you are able to see the movie yourself and at least be able to see the difference. I loved it, and being a horror movie junkie, Campfire Tales was like dessert for me!&#39;
b&#34;He&#39;s not your conventional cab driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guys got issues. With his wife, with his son, a priest, all his fares, his ex-partner and most of all himself. And the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it. So we have to keep watching to find out more about his past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea may not be original but David Morse makes it so. I think this is a great show, and I hope people catch-on before the season&#39;s over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!&#34;
b&#39;I saw this movie the day it opened in NYC, at the Ziegfield. At the time Madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now. She had a couple of hits, was very good in &#34;Desparately Seeking Susan&#34; and I had tickets to see her in concert at Giants Stadium. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Who\&#39;s That Girl?&#34; gives Madonna an actual role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. She does the madcap/heroine routine better than you might think. Griffin Dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story involves a huge cat named Murray, a bride-to-be who has slept with every cabbie in NYC, a mean father-in-law, and a key. There are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path. All the elements of a screwball comedy intact. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sir John Mills is seen briefly. He shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the Upper West Side, complete with a rain forest and everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to most Madonna movies (the ones I\&#39;ve been able to tolerate anyway), this is fantastic. On its own, its not that bad. 6/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS The concert was lousy.&#39;
b&#34;I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork &amp; Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being &#39;on&#39;, no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne &amp; Shirley), was enlightening. I also thought Richmond-Peck&#39;s Harvey was also a nice rock in the pond. (This is a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie told the age old story of Hollywood folks, going through the ups and downs of stardom. It kept me glued to my TV, and I learned to love Robin, well hell, mostly everybody seem to be the super people I sometimes think Hollywood is. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots. We never saw the head of ABC. Just heard him, like Charlie from Charlie Angels (I wonder if this way planed?). It seems so sad, that a show at number 1, could be so destroy by their own network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this story could be told about anyone&#39;s life, as they climb the ladder of any job. Movie, and TV stars are always loved or hated by so many people, that you grew up with, you just want to reach back in their past, to remember your own past. I Remember watching the show, and always wondering what does happen in their personal lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mork and Mindy, will always be part of me, and I got to see part of them. It may not all be the truth, it&#39;s also all not a lie, but in the end, it told me a wonderful sad, happy story.&#34;
b&#39;You can\&#39;t help but marvel at Hitchcock\&#39;s early work. &#34;Saboteur,&#34; for example, is so slick and quick that it\&#39;s hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago. There\&#39;s some propaganda elements but they\&#39;re woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later. You also get some previews of stuff that Hitchcock would do later--like using a national landmark as a backdrop. This time it\&#39;s the Statue of Liberty. In &#34;North by Northwest,&#34; of course, it\&#39;s Mt. Rushmore. You\&#39;ll also recognize things that pop up later in &#34;Rear Window&#34; and &#34;Vertigo&#34; in &#34;Saboteur&#34; but let\&#39;s not give away the show. Robert Cummings is excellent as is the oh-so-charming Otto Kruger. Look for Hitchcock\&#39;s mini-western in this one. It happens quickly so don\&#39;t blink.&#39;
b&#34;I first saw this film two years ago in the cinema, and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step-mother. Their relationship with their step-mother is strained to say the least, with the step-mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls. The film though slants with Oriental style ghost effects and horror, which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear, but is all the more intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direction is incredibly good, and the acting is stunning, with the step-mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film. The large house adds eeriness, and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. This film to me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment. You simply don&#39;t get anything like this in the Western World, sadly,and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended viewing in my opinion, a real joy and scare...&#34;
b&#34;This was one of those films I would always come across (be it on TV or cheap DVD), but never struck me to give it a shot as I thought I wasn&#39;t missing out on much. It was on one night and I thought oh well\xc2\x85 why not. A good decision too, as I would kick myself for taking so long to get around to it. For me it left me impressed, as it&#39;s up there with Burt Reynold&#39;s best features (&#39;Deliverance&#39;, &#39;White Lightning&#39; and &#39;Boogie Nights&#39;) and streams back to those 70s/80s gritty, hardboiled urban crime thrillers that weren&#39;t afraid to be forebodingly obscure and go out of their way to set-up characters, pack-it with realistically brutal force and effectively incorporate the local locations (Atlanta being the case here) to the fold with grounded photography. In certain shades it kind of reminded me of &#39;Dirty Harry&#39;, but that&#39;s loosely. However it&#39;s saucily honed blues score with its simmering kicks, funky shifts and unhinged sounds, very much had me thinking of Lalo Schifrin&#39;s pulsating score he orchestrated for &#39;Dirty Harry&#39;. The music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sgt. Tom Sharky was an Atlantic narcotic agent before a slip-out during a bust saw him demoted to vice work. Along with his new squad they come across a prostitution ring, which catches their interest due to fact it&#39;s owned by one hard-to-track and to convict crime lord. What they dig up involves a prominent government figure and a call-girl which can give them some important names, but they must get to her before she&#39;s made a target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt Reynold&#39;s acts, but also directs in an unyieldingly firm and muscular fashion which would suit his laconically hard-nosed performance and Gerald Di Pego&#39;s thematically hard-bitten and taut screenplay (that was adapted from William Diehl&#39;s novel). Well he does show some sort of heart/insightful thoughts amongst that armor within the scenes involving the fetchingly able British actress Rachel Ward, be it the stake-out scenes when he&#39;s watching her from another building (and slowly becoming infatuated by her) to when they finally come together, but these latter interactions mid-way through do slow up the momentum but give it noir like strokes. The performances are fairly spot on with Reynold&#39;s formulating a great rapport with exceptional actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The scathing profanity and witty dialogues between these guys were a blast. As for the corrupt villains, Vittorio Gassman builds imposing strength and power, but it&#39;s Henry Silva (who seems born for these roles) icily cunning and unstoppable turn that makes the show. Where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fall into place. Plus his adrenaline-filled and violent cat and mouse climax with Sharky and his team is brilliantly done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exciting action passages might be quick and dry, but remain lethally violent like an immensely teeth-grinding interrogation sequence. Some handy, old fashion filming techniques add to the suspense. The intriguing material keeps it quite tactical being character derived, but when we think its smooth sailing it offers up a blunt surprise or two along with some intensely brunt confrontations.&#34;
b&#39;This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth. It is so true , that I don\&#39;t know Klapisch did to reach such a masterpiece... Definitely one of my top 5 movies. It reminds me of the famous song &#34;This is my life, my life, life is life...&#34; 10/10&#39;
b&#39;This is the middle cartoon of the three (between Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) and is the weakest of the three, while still being quite funny. It simply depends on one gag for too much of the action. Still a good cartoon. I feel a definite sympathy for Daffy in this one, which is rare for me. Daffy is so clearly overmatched that it almost becomes painful to watch at times. Good cartoon in an excellent series. Recommended.&#39;
b&#39;Halloween 666 (1995) The producer\&#39;s cut review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to Part five. If you thought the last chapter was dark, this one will really blow your mind. A mysterious &#34;Man in Black&#34; has raided the Haddonfield Police Department freeing Micheal Myers. In the process poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. What they want with her? Who knows, but let\&#39;s just say her long suffering will end soon. Doctor Loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing any more innocents (good luck). A friend of Loomis, Doctor Wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor. Another old face from part one guest stars as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing. For some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasn\&#39;t worth the average horror film watcher\&#39;s time. So they decide to dumb it down. Then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office. No matter what they did to the film, they made it worse. They should have left well enough alone. Hey, the film company knows better than the filmmakers now....don\&#39;t they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Producer\&#39;s Cut :Highly recommended &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Released version: Not recommended&#39;
b&#39;This is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it. The acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot. As a French &#34;Noir&#34; film, its language is certainly a lot earthier than its American counterparts, but to me this just added to the realism. Additionally, I liked how non-glamorous everyone was--particularly the husband and the lieutenant. About the only negative, and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10, is because there was a glaring plot hole. Like another famous French film, Dr\xc3\xb4le de Drame, the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning, but the characters made rather stupid decisions. For this, you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching--the payoff is well worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simply one of the finest French films I have seen. Period.&#39;
b&#39;My two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was. David Duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and Minnie Driver gave her usually competent performance. Some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny - especially one scene Minnie Driver has with a fellow &#34;transplant&#34; donee. I liked the fact that it was a movie that I could watch with my children and I wasn\&#39;t embarrassed by any scene whatsoever. Everyone in the movie theater was laughing and enjoying themselves. Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!&#39;
b&#34;Tremendous fun both as a film and as an excuse to sit back and play the &#39;oh, that&#39;s whassis name&#39; game. Every star of the golden age of English films seems to be in this one and it was a joy to see them. And the greatest of them all, Richard Wattis, was as tremendous as ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is actually a plot that trundles along very nicely, there&#39;s also some splendid jokes and comedic moments, but the key to this films triumph is the characters within it. Alastair Sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six foot, big-boned Scotsman could be the headmistress of a girl&#39;s boarding school. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments but, with Alastair and Richard, the star of the show is Joyce Grenfell. She is an absolute one-off and brings a smile whenever she&#39;s on the screen...her rolling-walk and plum accent done to perfection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those playing the , that&#39;s whassis name&#39; game, you can even spot Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look carefully.&#34;
b&#34;I watch a lot of movies. A LOT of movies. Getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch 2-3 flicks a day for years. It all gets very exhausting. Mostly because I feel I have seen it all. So rare is it when I get surprised by something, mostly I hope to see something as good as I expect it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death Bed is so unlike anything I have ever experienced I actually had to stop the DVD in order to rant about its genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rhythm of the piece is psychotic. It&#39;s structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside of the frame. It&#39;s not like something like Halloween with all its snappy editing and POV shots; Death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy. The most pretentious way I can phrase it is: this is Samuel Beckett making a haunted house movie. I mean it&#39;s a manic depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! Out in the middle of nowhere! And there&#39;s bone hands! I can barely articulate my feelings about this film. And yeah, copping to liking this will open you up to ridicule. But things get real same-y after awhile. Its hard to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged. I can honestly say this is a fully unique film up and down. From what it is to how its put together. We need films like that, movies that shake us out of our complacency. Consider it like existential camp. it&#39;s fun and it&#39;s stupid, but also brilliant in its weird little way. The worst horror villain of all time? Maybe, but at least it isn&#39;t a guy in a mask.&#34;
b&#34;Xavier,a French student moves into an apartment in Barcelona with a cast of six other characters from all over Europe. An Italian, a Danish, a German, a British, a Spanish and a Belgium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants to get a job in EU with the help of his father&#39;s friend. He says there are jobs here a lot, but if you know Spanish and Spanish market. So, he advice him to go Spain. Xavier gets an Eramus grand and fly to Barcelona by living his girlfriend and mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He first learns that the house he will stay is no longer available and the small rooms in Barcelona are even more expensive than he thinks. He stays in a French couples house while he was looking for a house. He has been interviewed with the 5 people from the house and has been accepted. He had an affair with this French guys lovely wife and totally messed up everything with his problematic girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to hear more? Did you travel abroad for education? Watch this movie, I promise that you will have a very nice time.&#34;
b&#39;I can\&#39;t get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. This is the first production I\&#39;ve ever seen of Sweeney Todd so I have no others to compare it to. But the impact is so strong, I just can\&#39;t imagine anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there\&#39;s the music -- take &#34;Johanna&#34; (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. It\&#39;s like a Bach chorale in that sense -- just a masterpiece of composition. And the underlying chord structure and voicings are so perfect -- a little bit of melancholy, a little bit of contentment, a little bit of yearning, all expressing these three singers\&#39; points of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then -- the lyrics. The rhymes are so clever. The rhyme schemes sometimes seem random but they always add up at the end. (The DVD, which I watched, has Closed Captions, and these are indispensable for appreciating the dialog and the lyrics.) Sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the performances. I can\&#39;t imagine anyone better than George Hearn. Why haven\&#39;t I heard of him before? His singing, alone, is masterful, but the range of his acting is simply amazing. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song about &#34;you and me down by the seaside&#34; -- who could do it any better? Her timing is flawless, pitch is perfect, every beat of the score is accounted for; and overlaying this achievement in musicianship is her utterly delightful comic delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a dark tale but I found it to be sweet at times; and the tune to &#34;Johanna&#34; continues to play in my head.&#39;
b&#34;The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney&#39;s movie about Holly, there&#39;s some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music. As a long-time Holly fan and rocker, so do I.&#34;
b&#34;I saw this movie so long ago, but it remains in my memory as the saddest movie ever. I cried non stop. My mother will not ever watch this movie again because its almost painful to watch. Anyway, apart from that the story isn&#39;t exactly complex...Ann Margaret is dying and has to give away her 10(?) children. As if that isn&#39;t bad enough, it is during the depression and she has to break up the close siblings one by one. I guess this was very sad to me because I too am from a very large close knit family and could identify with each child&#39;s pain of leaving their mother and siblings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am a masochist but I would like to see this movie again because it was well done and the end, surprisingly, is slightly happy (so at least we could smile and sob simultaneously). It should come on TV sometime so I can see it again.&#34;
b&#39;I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don\&#39;t usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn\&#39;t start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I\&#39;m not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of &#34;appointment&#34; TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don\&#39;t like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn\&#39;t have a DVR yet). So I guess it wasn\&#39;t until TBS starting running reruns on their daily lineup in the evenings that we started watching consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time we got hooked, there were only a couple more season\&#39;s left before the series was canceled. But we still watch it almost daily on TBS. I almost prefer to see series this way, because you can watch multiple episodes day after day and it helps to build continuity and what\&#39;s going on with the characters without having to wait a whole week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the episodes stand alone in the since that the stories don\&#39;t carry over from week to week. But that is fine with me, because you can watch an episode, then miss weeks - and still pick back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is the writing wasn\&#39;t always consistent. Some episodes would be outrageously hilarious, and then some would only be mildly funny. So, I\&#39;m not sure it had the quality of writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had. But I loved the casting and the characters are all quite believable and realistic. Kevin James is just plain funny to look at! So even if the plot isn\&#39;t that great, James body language and expressions make the show worth watching. Leah Remini is great as the &#34;play-it-straight&#34; wife. I think its harder to play the straight character for laughs, than the comedic character, and she does a great job. She has a knack at sarcasm and insults like no one else. She is one tough cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie\&#39;s dad, who lives with them in their basement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a great series and I was sorry when it cancelled. But a big thanks to TBS for keeping the King alive in reruns!&#39;
b&#39;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date, this year, it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and I knew what would happen far too early. Usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me (like &#34;The Others&#34;) but even knowing the outcome I still enjoyed it right up to the end. Looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from Kelly Overton (Eve), I\&#39;m afraid I was not. Her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me, in contrast to the amazing performance (or characterization) by James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope we see more of him. What a great little film, highly recommended to all!&#39;
b&#34;The Frogs Who Wanted a King or Frogland is Ladislaw Starewicz&#39;s most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that I&#39;ve ever seen. The ironic thing is that they pray to the god Jupiter for their answers. Jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork. Neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the amphibian creatures! The frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives! Like I said, this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children. In fact, I first saw this on the Rhino VHS that had Bambi Meets Godzilla. That alone should tell you what to expect here!&#34;
b&#34;Airplane apart, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever laughed at a film so much in all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love football like mad, but I tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic. This wasn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched it once, it was over 2 years ago &amp; it was brilliant. Everyone I know loved it. I remember the gay physio, the sloping pitch at about a 45 degree angle and &#39;Shoes&#39; (a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes). Brilliant, that&#39;s what goes on in park football.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite 10/10. If anyone from the TV industry is reading this, considering all the crap you repeat on English tele, please have the sense to show this again (and the Muppets while you&#39;re at it). Also does anyone know if this was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it&#39;s worth asking them if they plan to show it again. They should do.&#34;
b&#39;If you liked the Richard Chamberlain version of the Bourne Identity then you will like this too...Aiden Quinn does this one brilliantly, you can\&#39;t help but wonder if he is really out there...I reckon he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it\&#39;s so intense. When I first saw it I was just flicking channels on the remote late one evening..&amp; I got hooked within minutes. look up www.answers.com for Ilich Ram\xc3\xadrez S\xc3\xa1nchez who is the character that &#34;carlos the Jackal&#34; is based on for both... I remember reading about Ilich Ram\xc3\xadrez S\xc3\xa1nchez\&#39;s arrest in the paper in 1997. It was front page for weeks, through the trial after his arrest.&#39;
b&#39;I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy. I never heard of the actors before but I liked all three very much. I think they did a terrific job on their journey to self-discovery. All in all, this is an amazingly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film. I still carry many of the images in my mind.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Snow Queen&#34; is based, of course, on the fairy tale of the same name, collected in (at least) Andersen\&#39;s Fairy Tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this one retains the spirit of Faerie, an accomplishment not easy and not well understood by many, especially among Americans. Talking animals, arbitrary prohibitions, appearances of goblins, dragons, and demons, are not to be questioned in a fairy tale; they are as natural an element of Faerie as, say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely beside the point of the story. Nor is the story bound by modern Hollywood rules of composition: direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in lesser works, and obvious (in retrospect, at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this defence against the common criticisms of those who do not understand fairy tales, &#34;Snow Queen&#34; is a delightful movie with wonderful visual effects, skillful acting, and great sentiment. The only flaw in the movie was, I think, not that it was too fantastical but that certain parts of the dialogue were too glaringly modern in slang and expression, a mar on its otherwise timeless nature.&#39;
b&#39;We all want to fall in love... The experience makes us feel completely alive, where every sense is heightened, every emotion is magnified... It may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon, but that doesn\&#39;t reduce its value, because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love watching people fall in love... It must have something to do with the excellent chemistry between the main characters...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Elliott, a charming sensitive American war correspondent, arrives in Hong Kong at the dawn of the Korean war... He finds in Han Suyin an awesome beauty of true grace...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Han Suyin, a lovely Eurasian doctor is captivated by Mark\&#39;s tenderness and insight...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was instant attraction when they first met... The two commence a passionate affair, leading them to fall deeply in love...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their love is so strong, so wonderfully expressed that highlights Elliot\&#39;s married status, and the difficulties of the troubled time of the Korean War, communism and race relations... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holden is an inspired choice for the role... Not only does he have an imposing screen presence, but he brings the perfect mix of enlightenment, compassion and emotion to the part...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opposite him Oscar Winner Jennifer Jones, perfect in her oriental look, radiantly beautiful in that traditional and modern Asian-inspired Cheongsam... Jones floods her role with personal emotion giving her character a charismatic life of its own... She delivers a heartfelt performance turning her character into a woman who undergoes a spiritual and emotional awakening...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her scene in that verdant hill where she takes refuge is exquisitely touching specially when we heard Mark\&#39;s voice whispering: &#34;We have not missed you and I... that many-splendored thing.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry King - who has established himself as a masterful director of romances - spreads the theme tune (by Alfred Newman) in the air above the cosmopolitan harbor... His film is colorful, elegant, with excellent cinematography and set design...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nominated for eight Academy Awards, this beautiful and sensitive motion picture won three: Best Costume Design; Best Music and Best Score...&#39;
b&#34;Hey guy, this movies is everything about choices. All the times in your life you must pick something or it just pass away... And this movie prove that! Of course, life in fact is not like a beautiful picture as this movie shows... it not shows indeed but some may figure that. I&#39;m trying to say it&#39;s full of pain, love and deep lessons of live. Aaron, the Mormon missionary is the real shepherd digging out the thing beautiful deep inside Chisthian, the skin feeling guy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a great end and you do always believe in fate because it will surprise you in a turn or in other of your live like Latter Days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big deal watch it!!!&#34;
b&#34;I saw this at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and liked it a lot. It worked for me as a slightly weird comedy, because I don&#39;t like horror, but there were only a couple of minutes I had to close my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialog was good, the costumes and settings were not far off BBC-quality, which is amazing for an indie film. I liked the way the plot twists and even meanders, it kept surprising me in good ways. I even warmed up to the Willy Grimes character, who I quite disliked at the beginning. It would have been better if there&#39;d been any motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island: that felt very much like a plot device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fond of Dominic Monaghan, and he did a good job at pratfalls, horror, and at the more thoughtful moments. Nice voice in the narration, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a fun and unusual date movie.&#34;
b&#39;In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, &#34;Rabbit Seasoning&#34; makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqu\xc3\xa9 for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did. All in all, this just goes to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were.&#39;
b&#34;Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we&#39;ve had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country&#39;s strife. But in this movie, the director and screenplay did not fall into this clich\xc3\xa9. It turns out everyone in the story has some right and some wrong. it&#39;s a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.&#34;
b&#34;I love this movie ! I think I&#39;ve seen it 5 times already (it was quite a success in France and they often play it on TV). Ok, it&#39;s a thriller and there is great tension. But mostly (and specifically in the second part) it is absolutely hilarious ! And very original. The directing and photography are just splendid.&#34;
b&#39;This movie has been a favorite of mine and is entwined with the Christmas Holidays for me for two reasons: (1) growing up in the 1960s, everything was space-related from advertising to television programs and even Santa Claus found himself in spaceships during that era; and (2) I saw this movie during a Christmas shopping trip when I was ten years old and it brought back fond memories of my favorite TV shows when I was even younger (&#34;Supercar&#34;, Fireball XL5&#34;, and &#34;Stingray&#34;,). Therefore, I am a tad biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, as a long-time student of film, this is mainly a movie for fans of Gerry Anderson (and Barry Gray; oh, that gorgeous score!) whereas the casual movie-watcher will be put off by the future-vision-from-the-past (dig those wild cars, commercial aircraft, clothes, etc.) and the so-called &#34;plot twist&#34; which will cause some to groan. However, if you can look past the post-&#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34; desire to make a science fiction film with a &#34;far out&#34; story line, and if you enjoy imaginative special effects, then you will enjoy this gem from an era when man had just walked on the Moon and people were still looking up at the stars in wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down at the banal trappings of the actual 21st Century.&#39;
b&#34;Ok i know the original Ghoulies aren&#39;t in this entry it even seems it doesn&#39;t belong in this series. But it still iz a good movie. It is hilarious i thought especially with the pepper spray or mace. I give it a 9&#34;
b&#39;That is the promise of the trailer I saw and by which I rented Hitch. Exactly, a serious film viewer shall not expect much further from this title but, surprisingly enough, Smith, Mendes, James and Valletta managed to reach a theatrical performance which could be metaphorically summarised on their rap dance-floor routine by the end of the film: their characters formed an effective combo which may prompt more than a good laugh with this Sunday afternoon DVD, providing your date is not an exquisite, french-swedish-directors-of-the-60\&#39;s movie fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: The techniques to score are all TRUE, especially the &#34;cocktail girl&#34; routine!&#39;
b&#34;This film is a benchmark in non-mainstream cinema history. The use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of Strike (Eisenstein&#39;s 1st film). Take the scene on the steps and note the repeated shot of the soldiers descending, to reiterate the point of the horrors that actually did happen! A highly intelligent monumental film, a must see for all Film students!&#34;
b&#34;Just saw &#39;The League of Gentlemen: Apocalypse&#39; at a special screening in Manchester, with Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith of the League in attendance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the back was Peter Kay (who has a brief cameo in the film) affectionately heckling at the back during the Q &amp; A session after the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film was complicated (in a good way) and very very funny. It follows Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp as they try and save fictional Rosyton Vasey from the disinterest of their creators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The League play a wide range of their characters and themselves (or character based on themselves) and are ably supported by the cream of British character and comedy actors such as Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warner is a particular stand out reminding me of his smooth and cutting turn in &#39;Time Bandits&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film swims in and out of various realities and allows some of the denizen&#39;s of Rosyton Vasey some space to grow beyond their usual limits of their comedy shtick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Pemberton&#39;s Herr Lipp has a great Bretchian moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life which brings a lump to the throat at an unexpected moment and surprises you with its tender affection for the characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This echoes something Mark and Reece said in the Q &amp; A afterwards, that the plot of the league being tired of their famous characters is spurious and that the whole film is really a love letter to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a format that started as a radio character-based sketch show, these guys have really evolved the idea so far as to sustain a movie which takes you on a journey through fiction, &#39;reality&#39;, comedy, tragedy and a pleasing journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long form story from their 70 odd existing creations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fans of the show will love it. It pays off dedication and attention to detail in spades, the uninitiated may be a little lost, but the joy of the LoG was always the ability to almost instantly tune into their acutely observed characters and take the stylistic leap into farce and expressionistic movie homage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are homages a plenty in this one including &#39;The Shining&#39; and &#39;La Belle et la Bete&#39;, to name but two I spotted and they ably demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in 1690&#39;s England that makes perfect sense when you&#39;re engaged with the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, I marvelled, boggled, emoted and snickered throughout and they have definitely pulled off what many have failed at. A successful British TV comedy to cinema translation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;ve watched and enjoyed &#39;The League of Gentlemen&#39; in the past, go see it; you will enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#39;t, rent/buy a DVD and then go see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous Q &amp; A.&#34;
b&#34;Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra films have never disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect to watch. Mohabbatein remains as one of my favorite movies ever. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned movies, but definitely worth a watch. And SRK, who blew me away with an excellent performance in Baazigar, repeats a villain act. And this time he gets an experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol to support him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I comment on the acting, it is not just the acting, but the wonderful script that makes it worth a watch. It is the writing that compliments the great acting. The story is gripping, but the characterization is what stands out. The comedy track goes along well. But the movie has the tendency of shifting at romance too much. The viewer is bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of yawns. But the movie is still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his author backed role. Shahrukh Khan once again is sympathetic and cruel. You are bound to cry at the end. Juhi Chawla is decent. Her screams are bound to become annoying after a while. But in facial expression she is excellent. But her ending scene she is brilliant (though she was overshadowed by SRK). She has an author backed role that makes her very likable. Sunny Deol is adequate. His character was very likable, but too perfect. And it gets boring after a while. He does a good job though. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role felt a little out of place. Tanvi Azmi supports well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs are enjoyable and come at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song, and presentation is very 90&#39;s film like. Tu Mere Saamne (You are in Front of Me) and Likha Hai (Written Here) are nice love songs. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (Close the Door) is a decent love song also. The instrumental song is danced to perfection as well as the naughty wedding song Solah Button. The movie may not be perfect, but it is well worth your time especially if your favorite actor is in it.&#34;
b&#34;When you think of brilliant Australian comedy you don&#39;t think of Skit shows (Although I&#39;m quite partial to a bit of 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s Full Frontal) or even Sitcoms - you think of SATIRE! Something that we Australians really know how to do well. (Eg: Front Line, The Micallef Program) We know how to take the pi$$, and The Chaser&#39;s War on Everything, is a classic example of how to do it, and how to do it really well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve been a huge fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel for a long time. I remember listening to them on Triple J&#39;s afternoon show. They were, and remain, two of the funniest comedians around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I was sad when they left Triple J, I was excited to find out what they were investing so much time in that made them have to leave. (They were doing CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I figured this was something much bigger) And what an amazingly HILARIOUS show Chaser is. Biting political and social satire at it&#39;s best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m also pleased to say that it has recently received a MUCH better time slot than Friday nights and has been moved to Wednesday nights right after Spicks and Specks. THANK YOU ABC!! Finally I don&#39;t have to tape it! :)&#34;
b&#34;This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty .Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness, but it is a springboard for learning these people, they &#39;re life styles and pasts which support this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two lead actors (Bohl, Brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen. %100 believable, they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly, into their world. The actors&#39; seamless acting teamed with Bechard&#39;s Beautiful, realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale.This film is visual treat- soft ,increasing the intensity of The story. The soundtrack serenades the viewer, soothing yet drawing out the emotional content of the film. I find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece. intriguing.intense.&#34;
b&#34;Leos Carax has made 3 great movies: Boys Meet Girls, Mauvais Sang, Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth, the beauty of juvenile wilderness. Carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was, but he tried to make his own vision of the art, without thinking about about all he have seen, but using it and melting it into his times. Pola X is a very different movie because Carax made Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a monstruosity of 20 millions dollars, a film that has destroyed everything on its way. After such a movie you can&#39;t do another one in the same point of view. So Leos Carax has to changed, and he did. The movie isn&#39;t as beautiful as its first, it&#39;s more reasonable, no more studio, no more dreamed Paris, Carax has entered at last reality. It&#39;s not clean anymore, it&#39;s not poetic characters. Carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it.&#34;
b&#39;This, without any doubt, is the greatest spin off to Jackass ever made, hell, it even blows Jackass out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture this: You have a group of guys who just didn\&#39;t want to grow up, throw in a ton of money, and some seriously cool stunts, and you have Viva La Bam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show, it\&#39;s such a family-based one, and it\&#39;s not just &#34;the gang&#34; running around being complete jerks (like in Jackass). For example: Bam\&#39;s parents, April and Phil, are in every episode, with appearances of Bam\&#39;s obese uncle, Don Vito to boot! The reason why the Margera family makes us laugh is simple: Somebody in our family can relate. April: The woman who wants to live life by the book and follow tradition. Phil: The guy who tries to be a good father, and finally, Bam: That son that never grew out of high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pranks and jokes in every episode will give you a guaranteed laugh, and buying the DVDs is definitely recommended! Another thing which is surprising to see, is how casual Margera is over the whole thing. He\&#39;s said in interviews that for the majority of episodes, he isn\&#39;t acting, and is just acting off instinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked the most about the whole thing, however, is the amount of influence Margera has over MTV. He wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did it. He wanted to hang with Dani Filth for a day and have a Cradle Of Filth concert in his backyard, it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to this his passion for the love-metal (and debated as emo) band H.I.M and his brother\&#39;s garage band CKY, and there\&#39;s a whole lot of head banging going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you liked Jackass, you\&#39;ll fall in love with this. I borrowed Season 1 from a friend last year, and I would give up my legs to meet the Viva La Bam Crew. You will not be disappointed, and I can promise you\&#39;ll be in stitches by the end of it all!&#39;
b&#34;As a Sci-fi movies fan I also like Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. It maches well into Alien series. But it isn&#39;t alien, it&#39;s something else. OK, enough comparisons. This movie but me think: Why people are afraid of dark. You can&#39;t run away from dark. It&#39;s impossible. You have to be faced with darkness and with that, what&#39;s in dark. In this movie I also liked that the Vin Diesel character Richard B. Riddick wasn&#39;t typical good-boy. He had a secrets and he has done bad things in the past. To the other people he is a hero who tries to save them all. First of all he want to get out of that planet himself. There is also other metaphors in this story. Every big sci-fi fan should see this picture.&#34;
b&#39;A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT (&#34;scapegoat&#34;) for a dangerous escaped murderer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful, hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best. In what is essentially a series of chases, Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination. Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats, Buster Keaton (1895-1966) mastered physical comedy at a very early age. An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic, silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928. Writer, director, star &amp; stuntman - Buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience. More akin to Fairbanks than Chaplin, Buster\&#39;s films were full of splendid adventure, exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable. His theme of a little man against the world, who triumphs through bravery &amp; ingenuity, dominates his films. Through every calamity &amp; disaster, Buster remained the Great Stone Face, a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the late 1920\&#39;s Buster was betrayed by his manager/brother-in-law and his contract was sold to MGM, which proceeded to nearly destroy his career. Teamed initially with Jimmy Durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies, Buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent. Finally, before lung cancer took him at age 70, he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered. Now, well past his centenary, Buster Keaton is routinely recognized &amp; appreciated as one of cinema\&#39;s true authentic geniuses. And he knew how to make people laugh...&#39;
b&#34;Writer-director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film. His dialogue was snappy, and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film&#39;s narrative structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of the film is the character of Alice, who is running away from her New England past in a desperate effort to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a pair of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who incredibly make the attempt to groom Alice as a prostitute earning money at truck stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a newcomer performing in her first screen role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There is not a false note in her character choices. But the film is worth watching above all for the wily yet sensitive character of Sandra, as masterfully created by Judith Ivey. There is an especially sly subtext to virtually every moment in which Ivey is on-camera. As a viewer, I found myself stopping the tape, hitting rewind, and reviewing her scenes in order to attempt to discern the psychological subtleties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film raises the following question about the characters: Are Bill and Sandra good Samaritans, or are they an evil pair of Dickensian predators preying upon the youthful Alice? One of the strengths of the film is that it never quite fully answers that question. Alice seems more self-confident than she started out as a result of her experiences with Bill and Sandra. But is she really a better person?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part comedy, part road picture, and part coming-of-age drama, this carefully crafted film succeeds in involving us on many levels.&#34;
b&#39;This is actually a very good surreal mystery movie, despite the description that tries to sell it as a Sci-Fi movie. Balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together. She spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions. Very atmospheric and effective. It is true that Kinski does not appear very much in this film, but the staring actors are very good. There is only an English dubbed version available in the US, and the dubbing leaves something to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. The cinematography, by Academy Award winner Vittorio Storaro is excellent. An earlier Giallo by director Bazzoni, THE FIFTH CORD, is also excellent, and also lensed by Storarro.&#39;
b&#34;I am no Ebert. What I am is a compassionate and I have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than I felt for Leland P. Fitzgerald. Sorry if I do not offer a critique, but I see nothing but perfection in this film. I am sure that many who watch this film will never see the same things I do, but if you look hard enough maybe you will see something you weren&#39;t expecting. I&#39;ve read that the character of Leland was flawed. It seems to me that who wrote this was not able to see past the Question this movie presents. I feel sorry for anyone who doesn&#39;t see the answers this movie delivers. Open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this Leland P. Fitzgerald show you a world that truly has a meaning. Excepcional story with extraordinary acting. Ryan Gosling deserves to be talked about.&#34;
b&#34;I saw what I believe to be the best Australian film of the year so far, Jon Hewitt&#39;s Acolytes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise. Get this\xc2\x85two bullied and molested teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb AND then set about blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them. Hewitt has picked a top notch cast including excellent new comers Sebastian Gregory, Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teens. Add to that three, yes, thats right three great psycho&#39;s! Lead by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour, Belinda McClory his deranged spouse and Michael Dorman as the teen raping bully, with swastika tattoos. Once you add these teens and these menacing adults, all hell breaks loose\xc2\x85 Hewitt has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished. You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynch&#39;s Twin Peaks but Hewitt makes it all his own, in a Qld suburban back water, always ringing with the drones of emptiness. The script by Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If marketed correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens. The next Wolf Creek? It could well be. It makes all the right moves. The teens are real ala Larry Clark. They don&#39;t suck and have an attached PC agenda, they are non communicative, good looking and hip. The killers are dark with real menace. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the mild mannered local Ted Bundy, who sports a butterfly on his 4WD spare ala John Fowles The Collector. Dorman&#39;s petrol head rapist pours on the menace that tops Suburban Mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you can&#39;t wait to see buy the farm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is fast paced, tough and brutal. Not only that, it displays a confidence and directorial mastery from Hewitt that is surely to win him an IF or AFI nomination, if not award! Its nuanced and poetic mise en scene, brilliant sound design, excellent cinematography and tight structure mark it as clearly one of the best directed Oz features I have seen so far this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film leaves you shaken, thinking and unsettled. Its a truly great edition to the return to genre going on in Australian cinema at present. It will surely garner the interest of Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention it got into Toronto? What other Oz feature films can say that much? The world should get ready for a new auteur, Jon Hewitt.&#34;
b&#39;This documentary was my first introduction to Peak Oil theory. A fascinating concept that has a lot of frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct. I had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon, it literally took my breath away. This movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the American way of life is dependent on the &#34;abundance of cheap oil&#34; - a term used throughout the film. A lot of the topics are plain common sense, and they don\&#39;t go into a huge amount of depth about any of them. But you\&#39;ve probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does. The interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I don\&#39;t think this film is meant to scare people. It\&#39;s merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead, and maybe to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100miles to work and leaving your lights on all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching this film I was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming by quite the same. Great documentary, everyone should see it.&#39;
b&#34;Considering it&#39;s basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too. Charles Martin Smith also does a great job in this film.&#34;
b&#34;I loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by Candace and Jacqueline. However, I never knew until now, watching a Bette David marathon on TNT that this film is a remake of a 1943 Bette Davis classic called Old Acquaintance. Bette co-stars with Miriam Hopkins who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because Bette had had an affair with Miriam&#39;s husband who directed her in a film before they made Old Acquaintance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, both are worth every minute spent watching. I highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama. It&#39;s a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;ve read every adventure of Asterix and Obelix at least 5 times and I\&#39;m also a fan of &#34;Les Nuls&#34; and &#34;Les Robins des Bois&#34; and Jamel so I expected a lot from this movie.... and I finally got satisfied. Unlike the first adaptation of Asterix on the big screen (Ast\xc3\xa9rix et Ob\xc3\xa9lix contre C\xc3\xa9sar) which wasn\&#39;t a real success besides the appearance of Laetitia Casta, this one really captures the spirit of the comic (and we get the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first movie the director tried to be too realistic about the time where the story is set and it killed the whole spirit that made Asterix hilarious. In this one all the clothing, the way of talking and everything is identical to Goscinny and Uderzo\&#39;s work... more, it really stick to the original story with the downside that we know pretty much everything that\&#39;s going to happen but Alain Chabat gave us a few surprises at the end. I really enjoyed that movie, and everytime that the first sign of boringness starts to appear, Jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. This movie is a big mix of all the kind of humor I really like, and even if maybe it\&#39;s mixing it too much, I can\&#39;t help but to like it. So, if you like Asterix and the humor of all these young talents that started in &#34;Nulle part Ailleurs&#34; (a french mix of the tonight show and SNL) go see this movie.&#39;
b&#34;Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie. I guess we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real, that you can&#39;t explain them with any means that these are just actors and not real persons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Nurse Betty&#39; isn&#39;t a nurse at all. In real life she is an ordinary housewife who works at a diner. To escape from her awful husband and the problems in her miserable life, she has become a very dedicated fan of a soap opera. After she witnessed her husband being murdered, she goes into some kind of a shock and she loses all grip on reality. She thinks she&#39;s in love with one of the characters from the soap opera, a doctor, and decides that she&#39;ll visit him and start a family with him. The hit men however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I already said, the subject is quite recognizable (if you leave the professional hit men and the murder out of it) and the movie was funny. The story was well directed and the actors did a fine job. It had everything I always want to see when watching a comedy. I give it a 7.5/10.&#34;
b&#39;Brown returned to his role from the year before (in &#34;Slaughter&#34;) for this rough follow-up film. In the original, he had avenged his parents\&#39; slaying by wiping out a huge mob organization in Mexico. Here, he is the one being pursued (retaliated against) by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon. When the first assassination attempt fails, Brown is back in action once more, kicking gangster butt all over the place while trying to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. While the original film was, overall, a better and more coherent movie, this one delivers all the exploitation aspects in far heavier doses, making it more pleasing to fans of the genre. Aside from a fairly dreary opening on horseback and a downright deadly car ride down a city street at night, this movie clips along at a very brisk pace. Every few minutes there appears one or more of the following: drug use, sex, nudity, gunplay, murder or some other action. Brown is his usual reliable, amiable self, helped by his amazing physical presence which goes a long way in glossing over any stiffness in his acting. McMahon is a riot! With tinted glasses and his hair parted down the middle (!), he is shown meting out orders to his gang of thugs and is overheard making passionate love to his fur-clad bimbo. Seeing Johnny Carson\&#39;s sidekick in a role like this is a perverse thrill. Stroud makes an impression as an intense, racially-bigoted hit-man while Peters adds just a tinge of class as an upright police detective who enlists Brown\&#39;s aid. Sadly, no mention at all is made of Brown\&#39;s original sidekicks Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is likable enough, but lacking in the voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before. Williams does an outrageous turn as a pimp who can seemingly pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his harem. The cinematography and overall direction is less polished than the first film, but this one does have a drive and a sense of danger that exceeds the original\&#39;s feel. The film spends a lot of time in the sewage of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, but it retains interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the now-startling lack of political correctness. One odd note: A key supporting player in the first film was shown getting shot to death, but pops up here in a different role.&#39;
b&#39;I started watching this expecting the worst, i was happy to find that the film turned out to be enjoyable, slightly confusing in parts, like when they all justs started singing. It gave me a chance to see Daniel Wu in action for the first time, he is a better actor than i thought, at times he seemed a bit out of place. I thought purple storm deserves its Hong kong legends release, as it is different to most other HK films, it is about a mans emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss, it may sound corny but when he eventually pieces out what and who he actually is it really makes the film a lot more interesting. Once you get into the film you will find it keeps you gripped to it, as if you miss one bit then a lot of the film wil make sense, for example i missed a bit at the start and i recommend to anyone that watches this that they do not miss any of it. So i can say that this film was worth watching and a grateful surprise for me, that i enjoyed it.&#39;
b&#34;If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic, and artistic, with splashes of very grim humor. THIRST is clearly Park&#39;s style, and I loved every second of it, from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story, which blends Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror, and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, bold, consistently surprising filmmaker. It&#39;s unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart-wrenching to laugh-out-loud hilarious in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE then SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE as far as being over-the-top and comical. But, like LADY VENGEANCE, it&#39;s incredibly rich, thought-provoking, and rewarding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like beautifully told vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park, seeing THIRST should be obvious. Easily one of the best films of 2009.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Subconscious Cruelty&#34; has to be one of the most disturbing films I\&#39;ve ever seen. &#34;Salo&#34; and &#34;Cannibal Holocaust&#34; didn\&#39;t bother me that much, but there\&#39;s a strange psychological element to &#34;Subconscious Cruelty&#34;. This film invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos, surrealist visuals and one of the most unsettling film scores and sound designs. Repulsive at times; yes, but its visual flair can be compared to Avant Gard directors such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makavejev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and throw in the graphic violence of a film by Luico Fulci, and you might be able to guess what you\&#39;re in for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is divided into 4 parts. The first part &#34;the Ovarian Eye&#34; is real short. A narrator tells us about the the parts of the brain and its functions. Then a nude woman gets her stomach cut open and an eyeball is pulled out. The second part &#34;Human Larvae&#34; is kind of like the film &#34;Eraserhead&#34; but with incest. It deals with a man\&#39;s sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. Where\&#39;s Frued when you need him? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of &#34;Begotten&#34; and Jame\&#39;s Broughton\&#39;s 1972 short film &#34;Dreamwood&#34;. In this segment people have sex with the earth. Men hump bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. The branches bleed when broken. Watch in horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife sticking out of a woman\&#39;s vagina. These people really know how to get in touch with nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last part of the film is the most disturbing and at times it borders on hardcore pornography. This part of the film made me think of Jodorowsky\&#39;s &#34;the Holy Mountain&#34;, &#34;Sweet Movie&#34; and &#34;Cannibal Holocaust&#34;. I\&#39;ve never been more disturbed in my life by what I witnessed. A business man gets his privates pulled apart by fishhooks. Yuck and Ouch! Two women urinate on a Christ figure and proceed to cannibalistically eat him like communion bread and sodomize him with a tree branch. Poor guy. The last part was so extreme that if I ever watch the film again, I\&#39;ll have close my eyes or slightly fast forward. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are obviously very talented, To think they did this project in there early 20\&#39;s. Hussein went on to direct the Tarkovsky influenced &#34;Ascension&#34; (2002) which is a much better film and he co-write the screenplay for Nacho Cerda\&#39;s after dark horror masterpiece &#34;the Abandoned&#34;. &#34;Subconscious Cruelty&#34; is a fascinating and unsettling journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds. Well, sort of.&#39;
b&#34;This little-known comedy from the hit play by Ruth Gordon is a delight. The script, based on the play, is spicy, rich, and completely undated. Ditto the cast but I must underline the work of the leading lady,Irene Dunne. Irene is simply superb - as usual - and lights up the screen with every frame she&#39;s in (and she&#39;s in it a lot, thank heaven). In addition, director Vidor has given her some unusual close-ups that are mesmerizing. What a gal! I know of no other Hollywood actress from any era who has her versatility and is so convincing in every film. Why she remains so little known is a mystery. I have seen most of her films and this one was a surprise, even for a solid ID fan like myself. See it, everyone!&#34;
b&#34;This is a brilliant series along the same lines of Simpsons. Following a family as they go through life and problems etc. Slightly less realistic than Simpsons, talking baby and dog anyone? Family Guy goes where SImpsons or Futurama dares not, reaching past into the sicker jokes and more racy gags. And believe me, it works! Almost all the gags hit the mark and they&#39;ll have you in stitches(especially the random, frequent flashbacks!) When my brother first showed me this I wasn&#39;t hooked but after a few episodes I was hooked. You will be 2. 10/10 for a truly brilliant show. COngrats to Seth Macfarlane for bringing this show to life. :)&#34;
b&#39;If you\&#39;re familiar with the work of auteur Johnny To and his band of filmmaking cronies over at Milky Way, you know what to expect with this latest production. All the familiar elements are in place: the strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a cop and a baddie, the coincidences and chances that turn on a dime and pay off handsomely in the end, and the humor that arises even in the most dire of situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company. Lau Ching-Wan (also brilliant in other Milky Way films like &#34;Longest Nite,&#34; &#34;A Hero Never Dies,&#34; and &#34;Where A Good Man Goes&#34;) portrays a hostage negotiator/cop who is on the robber\&#39;s tail, even as the robber sets up a series of tricks and clues that he must follow in order to get his man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, poignant, and cool while being subtle, &#34;Running&#34; is actually one of the most entertaining Milky Way films to date. Don\&#39;t miss the performances by the two leads, esp. Andy Lau, usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to watch. This film is one to go out of your way to see.&#39;
b&#34;Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It&#39;s Werner Herzog&#39;s most unconventional film. It doesn&#39;t have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we&#39;re given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It&#39;s not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren&#39;t actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror. The use of music in this movie is so brilliant - from Leonard Cohen, Mozart, and the Third Ear Band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick&#39;s 2001: A Space Odyssey in the desert; that&#39;s what this movie is like. This film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as though your spirit has left your body. A must see. It will change the way you view films. Rating: 10 out of 10.&#34;
b&#39;An excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone. I liked this movie because Glenn Corbett also appeared in Star Trek as Zeffrem Cochrane in 1967. I also liked it because I am a fan of the apollo space program.&#39;
b&#34;Grave robber is sitting in his cell awaiting execution is visited by a monk wishing to take down his last words for posterity and as a warning to others about the horrible life he lead. At first reluctant, but with his tongue loosened up by drink the young grave robber is soon telling his story which is full of the dead, the undead and things that go bump in the night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York lensed horror film (filmed in part on Staten Island which no doubt brought the spirit of Andy Milligan lurking about) is one of the better horror comedies to come around in a while. This is an often very funny film that just spins its story out in every which way. The cast is first rate. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake the grave robber telling his story. Ron Perlman is Father Duffy the monk taking the statement and perhaps getting too involved in the tale. Both men are clearly having a grand old time and it shows. The rest of the cast is equally as good. The music by Jeff Grace is excellent. The effects are perfect for this sort of ghoulish silliness. The film is a great deal of fun. If there is any trouble with the film its that perhaps it throws its net a little wide so as the result has way too much going on. I don&#39;t want to give too much away but I don&#39;t think we needed the alien body in the mix. Still this is a great deal of fun and its one I&#39;m pretty sure I will revisit on the IFC in Theaters where I saw it the first time, and later on I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll pick up the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a look.&#34;
b&#34;Victor Sjostrom&#39;s silent film masterpiece The Phantom Carriage has recently been released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL. The duo, comprising American guitarist Stephen O&#39;Malley and Austrian laptop artist Peter Rehberg, has conjured an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original film footage from 1921. An ominous banging sound introduces each Act and a medley of drones, guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As impressive as the new soundtrack is, the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this tale the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on New Year&#39;s Eve is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous phantom carriage, collecting the souls of the dead. This is the fate of the anti-hero of the film, David Holm, who is moved to painful scrutiny of his life following his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the carriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a fitting label, the real horror here resides not in the supernatural elements but rather in the depiction of human suffering at the hands of others. Sjostrom gives a remarkable performance as the drunken, spiteful and menacing Holm in life, and the wretched, frightened Holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Striking imagery abounds throughout The Phantom Carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. The ill-omened onset of midnight is powerfully illustrated through the image of a clock-face hovering alone in the darkening night sky like a second moon. Equally impressively, the dead are depicted through pioneering semi-transparent imagery and the scenes of the phantom carriage riding over land and sea remain chilling to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sjostrom&#39;s film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films of all time and the new soundtrack by KTL is a superb accentuation of its themes. This is a must-see.&#34;
b&#34;The Merchant of Four Seasons isn&#39;t what I would call a happy movie, at all, or even one that impressed me to the point of praising it to the sky (there are other Fassbinder flicks for that, like Veronika Voss and the underrated Satan&#39;s Brew). But it&#39;s certainly no less than a fascinating experiment in taking a look at those in a society that you and me and others we know might possibly know, or not really want to know. I imagine in the early 70s in Germany a generation, coming out of WW2, had a stigma to live with but tried their best just to get by. This is a stigma that floats all over this film, and in many instances in Fassbinder&#39;s work in general, but especially because with Four Seasons he takes his eye on the middle class, and a particular married couple- the distanced, depressed, angry Hans the fruit seller and his long-suffered wife- that is nothing short than trying for realism in the guise of melodrama. If Cassavetes were a crazy German he might make this film, maybe even as just a lark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story sounds simple enough, where Hans&#39; drinking gets out of control, he beats his wife (this scene is one of the toughest to take, maybe in just any movie, the way Fassbinder&#39;s camera lingers without a cut as his wife is left helpless and their daughter trying to stop him in his frenzy) and then she&#39;s ready to leave him. As he stands in the room, her family holding him back, she makes the call for divorce and he gets a heart attack right there. He recovers, his business suddenly starts booming again with some help from some good (or not so good) employees - and yet this only continues his longing, for another woman, and his despair in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet it&#39;s in this simplicity that Fassbinder tries, and succeeds for the most part, in attaining a mood of dread, of a tense vibe in a kitchen or in the bedroom or out on the street that you can cut with a knife and bleed out. The weakest part of this all may be the acting... at least that was my initial impression. Hans, played by Hirschmuller, can be a stilted presence, with only the slightest movements in his face and eyes, and for a while it doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s much of a good actor. The actress playing his wife, Irm Hermann, and her sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla) fare better, but only cause they&#39;re given more to do conventionally, like cry or look concerned. It takes some time to adjust to what is, essentially, a void in his guy Hans, of something from his own psychological self-torment or self-pity that pervades himself and those around him who just want to get on with some sense of normalcy, especially once Hans gets successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everything clicks together in The Merchant of Four Seasons, but enough did to make me recommend it to those looking for a different slice-of-life than you might be used to with more modern American movies. Fassbinder&#39;s world here is a combat between the melodrama he loves in cinema and the harsh, crushing sense of humanism that he feels personally and puts into characters that, for better or worse, we somehow identify with. Are the Epps a family you know of? Or could you even be them? Who&#39;s to say. It&#39;s a methodical study of tragic emptiness in the human spirit, and its goals are all attained.&#34;
b&#39;I saw this movie tonight in a preview showing and it was fantastic. It does well in portraying issues that the average High School student is subjected to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the movie feeling stunned and saddened and yet grateful that this movie will have a chance to raise awareness through its audiences regarding these issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a Fantastic Aussie Film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn from it.&#39;
b&#39;Not everyone likes this movie. It is still one of the best &#34;you have to be thinking&#34; movies about Satanism ever made. The fact that it doesn\&#39;t have MTV-era jump cuts or gore every seven minutes is irrelevant. Also, speaking as someone who actually KNOWS Satanists, the (spoiler warning!) portion of the film where the Brotherhood exchange their old bodies for those of preadolescent children, it has some genuinely scary scenes. The section where (second spoiler alert) Strother Martin orchestrates the changeover is almost hyper-real in that it uses very few special effects, a hallmark of this film. McEveety was seldom given a big budget but was often effective. It worked in this case, too.&#39;
b&#34;Meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it&#39;s impossible to count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In what was merely a precursor of what was to come, Murray rules the screen in what can only be described as comic mastery. Tripper Harrison is one of the greatest comedy characters in the past 50 years. Sarcastic all the time, smart when he has to be, stern when he needs to be, and caring when it suits him, Murray infuses Tripper with that SNL glint in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The C.I.T&#39;s are merely in awe as they cower beneath the comic genius that is Mr. Murray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer isn&#39;t summer without a viewing of Meatballs. One of the best comedies to ever grace the screen.&#34;
b&#34;Bart The Genius Whilst not the first Simpsons episode, Bart he Genius more or less is the first typical episode. There&#39;s no gimmickry or theme it&#39;s just your typical Simpsons episode in set-up. It always seems to me that it&#39;s an episode that grows on you. There are certain elements I don&#39;t care for, largely the blotchy animation which can be forgiven. But over time I take a liking to this story of it&#39;s uniqueness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, it&#39;d be very hard for a live-action sit-com on a standard budget to do this episode due to the various different sets that show in this episode, the computer bays in Ms. Melon&#39;s class, the opera and so on. My point is with that, The Simpsons realises one of the biggest strengths in animation. The sheer lack of visual limitations when compared to live-action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a writing stand-point it&#39;s also highly intelligent and fresh. The concept is pretty unique, and particularly the problems faced. Instead of the ol&#39; fail-safe that work was too hard, it was simply Bart&#39;s social isolation from his classmates that failed him (although the exploding science experiment may prove otherwise...which I also think is one of the best visual gags of the series.) The ending seems a little unoriginal, largely because the Bart running naked into his room to avoid Homer was already done in the shorts, but still funny for Marge and Lisa&#39;s short back-and-forth if for nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately it&#39;s a very good episode, with lots of interesting new point in the series, though not exactly perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the now iconic name Kwijybo was of course unleashed onto the world.&#34;
b&#34;The dreams of Karim Hussain are to be feared. When the right hemisphere of his characters overpowers the left, shocking images of blood, dismemberment, and various abominations are released. Religion won&#39;t save you, nor will mother nature or your own family. Hussain&#39;s dark poetry, because that&#39;s what this film really is, destabalizes all institutions of sanctuary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;`Subconcious Cruelty&#39; is a current crowd pleaser on the horror\\fantasy festival circuit. The film&#39;s opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound. The protagonist&#39;s desire to profane the birthing process which brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrific and credible illogic. From here the film continues deeper into the subconcious and tackles mother nature. Hussain offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness. Nature is exposed as blood-drenched and violent in Hussain&#39;s frightening enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;`Subconcious Cruelty&#39; is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature themes of life, lust and madness this very worthy film explores. CJ Goldman deserves kudos for his special make-up, as do David Kristian for unnerving sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for score.&#34;
b&#39;No blood, no sex (though it oozes passion), no special effects, but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you\&#39;re not really looking and grabs your attention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great acting, great sets, great music, beautiful storyline. If only there were a lot more movies made like this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting appears like real life, and elevates us to the level of awareness of &#34;Nanny&#34;, to whom no-one is a lost cause, least of all the inhabitants of her own &#34;Halfway&#34; house. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all it\&#39;s a true story of misfits learning to &#34;fit in&#34;. I was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie! Could we all spend some time in Nanny\&#39;s house?&#39;
b&#39;Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including &#34;N.I.B.&#34;, &#34;War Pigs&#34;, and &#34;Paranoid&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans.&#39;
b&#39;Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner\&#39;s mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O\&#39;Malley meets up with them and offers to help them. When Edgar sees them arriving home, he is furious, and starts to mail them to Timbucktu. But Thomas\&#39; friends arrive to help save the day. The wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in Paris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a charming film. The songs, including &#34;Everybody Wants to be a Cat&#34;, are lively and upbeat. The voice cast is excellent, with Eva Gabor(who would later play Miss Bianca in Disney\&#39;s THE RESCUERS films) as Duchess, Phil Harris(Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters. Supposedly Walt Disney, before he died in 1966, gave the go-ahead to this film. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.&#39;
b&#39;This game requires stealth, smart, and a steady hand. The gameplay is simply the best; on top of that though are the interesting extras - bullet holes stay in the walls, enemies react to specific points where they have been hit by bullets, there are tons of motion captured animations that make the enemies seem very real (for instance when looking through a window at a guard he will stand there swatting flies away, sneezing, or scratching himself), the list goes on. This is the best licensed/movie conversion ever and it puts you in the shoes of the suavest super spy. This game is the best reason for owning an N64.&#39;
b&#39;I saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it, but even more shocked by some of the comments I have read here. One person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not--therefore... One person wrote that since he wasn\&#39;t an American citizen, therefore... Some people comment that the people in the Middle East hate us and want us dead, therefore... So are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime? Are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an American Citizen? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead? Are we saying that, as is written in the Geneva Convention, the Declaration of Human Rights and the Constitution of the United States that &#34;torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others?&#34; When does it become &#34;right&#34; to torture? THAT is why this movie is powerful-- it is ambiguous, but not about torture. Torture is always wrong, and if we are willing to do it, even in the name of justice and &#34;National Security&#34; or &#34;freedom and democracy&#34; then we are wrong and we are evil; we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing (and we are calling them &#34;wrong&#34; in the same breath.) My favorite line in the film was &#34;if you don\&#39;t want to compromise join Amnesty International.&#34; Right on.&#39;
b&#39;Samuel Fuller knows war, and is one of the only directors in American movie history who could accurately portray the horrific experiences of it in a form like the motion picture. His pessimism and idealism, if that sounds a little odd to mix together, work for him as a storyteller, and at the same time he\&#39;s always out to tell the truth, however brutal (or put into melodramatic constructs) it can get. Verboten, however, deals with the post-war experience, as we only get in the opening scenes the big boom of WAR- in bold for a point. The opening shot is like one big exclamation point that seems to continue on into the rest of the scenes: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera pans up, we see another soldier shot down in war-torn terrain. Simple, direct language. Then Fuller punctuates the intensity with something interesting: the title song played over the opening credits as both irony and sincerity, and then Beethoven music over a shoot-out between Americans and the Nazis. Sgt David Brent (James Best) is shot, the battle goes on, and then it transitions to him being treated for his wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might lead one to believe that this will be a somewhat conventional WW2 flick (somewhat in that one usually wouldn\&#39;t find Beethoven and, later on to an extent, Wagner put into these images), but this isn\&#39;t the case. Instead, Fuller makes this a \&#39;Coming Home\&#39; kind of movie, though not at all in the sense that \&#39;this soldier comes home injured and so on and so on\&#39;. Instead of really going home, Brent stays on in Germany, as he\&#39;s fallen head over heels for the woman, Helga (Susan Cummings, pretty good at pulling off the German accent), and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the military so he can marry her. What he doesn\&#39;t realize is that a) she wants him more for money so she can get food for herself and brother, however this gets complex emotionally at the point of revelation to the slightly naive but heartfelt Brent, and b) there\&#39;s an underground Hitler youth sect called the Werewolves, who want to pick right up off where Hitler ended- starting small, despite argument within the group- by attacking the very government that\&#39;s now embedded in Germany to give them, as Brent describes, a &#34;blood transfusion.&#34; With this, plus footage from the Nuremburg trials, and (as narrated, I think, by Fuller himself) a quick, no-punches-pulled history of the Nazi war crimes piece by piece, we get a multi-faceted look at a society in the dire straits of an immediate post-war environment. While Rossellini handled it his own way with Germany Year Zero, Fuller tackles it with layers: first there\&#39;s the love story, or what is the tragic downfall of a man who can\&#39;t see anything past what he thinks should be reasonable, that it\&#39;s his wife and a child on the way that he can\&#39;t leave, until the revelation that he\&#39;s (partly) been swindled. Baker and Cummings, along with Harold Daye as Helga\&#39;s young, confused brother, perform at with the utmost detail to emotions; these aren\&#39;t very easy B-movie parts, though they could\&#39;ve been that. Then another layer is the political one, the struggle of a society to come to grips with being conquered, and a mentality which is made sensationalized, to be sure, by Fuller, in respect to making the Nazi\&#39;s a total no-gray-area thing: they\&#39;re evil, particularly when they cancel out reason to meet their ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally there\&#39;s the layer of style, which is strangely absorbing. This is probably one of Fuller\&#39;s \&#39;talkiest\&#39; films, which isn\&#39;t a bad thing considering it\&#39;s one of his best written scripts, as the characters don\&#39;t talk simply or in too many platitudes (with the exception of a small scene where two characters talk about the Hitler youth as juvenile delinquents, which is actually, according to Fuller\&#39;s autobiography, probably another layer to consider in the subtext and the 50s period of movies). And Fuller shoots this almost in a real European style, when he\&#39;s not going for fight scenes or battles, as the editing isn\&#39;t always very fast, and sometimes a cut won\&#39;t happen for a full minute, or longer. There\&#39;s an odd tension that grows out of this, especially when there\&#39;s something said by a character that gets another one wild-eyed or suspicious; Fuller could easily go for a big close-up, but there\&#39;s a more sinister, cold quality to not moving away from two people in a conversation without a simple over-the-shoulder deal. But when it requires it, like the big brawl outside the American military office, or the Nuremburg footage spliced into Franz\&#39;s memories of the Werewolves, Fuller can be as stunning stylist as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to find, but extremely worth it if you\&#39;r either a fan of the director\&#39;s or of WW2 movies set in Germany- or even just a history-buff- Verboten! is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional one, with a cast that is better than expected from a B-movie, and an attitude towards the \&#39;other\&#39; that is equally damning and thought provoking.&#39;
b&#34;Dylan and Bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are. But Dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside. Bobby knows that he&#39;s not interested in girls and misses what he had with Dylan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told as part cheesy 80&#39;s pop video, part home movie, part video recollection this film tells a confusing and sad, but all too often true, story that will hit home with many that see it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true chord with me but I wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there&#39;s always tomorrow, especially when we are young.&#34;
b&#34;then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I&#39;ll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle &amp; Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man. The story had heart, and was very influential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style from Hustle &amp; Flow into this movie, except took a new spin and used the Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. He also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No doubt, if you liked Hustle &amp; Flow, you will love this movie, and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this. I give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting film, and it is extremely under rated. shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go out and rent this movie.&#34;
b&#34;During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women &amp; children against a Yankee invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success. The little GANGsters would henceforth stick to short subjects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although he&#39;s given top billing &amp; the title role, George \xc2\x91Spanky&#39; McFarland is rivaled throughout the film&#39;s first half by little Billie \xc2\x91Buckwheat&#39; Thomas. Here were two of the finest young actors to ever appear in American movies. With all the experience of old, seasoned pros, these two gamin could steal scenes &amp; hearts with equal bravado. A constant joy, without a false note between them, they provide the essential reason for watching the film today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips Holmes gives a quiet, gentlemanly performance as Spanky&#39;s adult protector. Nearly forgotten now, Holmes was a fine actor who died much too soon, during World War Two. Genial Ralph Morgan is especially good as a sympathetic Union general - his scenes with Spanky are quite amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other OUR GANGers appear midpoint into the movie, most notably Carl \xc2\x91Alfalfa&#39; Switzer; he gets to warble \xc2\x91Just Before The Battle, Mother.&#39; Even pretty Rosina Lawrence (the GANG&#39;s schoolmarm) shows up to play Holmes&#39; beloved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irving Pichel is particularly slimy as a cowardly cardsharp turned vindictive Yankee captain. Bumbling Willie Best &amp; feisty Louise Beavers play Miss Lawrence&#39;s slaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that there is racism in the film, not unusual for Hollywood of that era - but almost completely missing in the original series of OUR GANG shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of 19th Century music will enjoy paying attention to the soundtrack, which is a long succession of ancient tunes.&#34;
b&#39;I saw this movie for the first time just a short while ago. If you ask me it does not get the credit it deserves. It is a little like American Pie meets Fast Times at Ridgemont High but with more depth. It handles the same issues as both movies, but in a way that holds with it some grain of truth. The ending is sad, but that is how life is. I think everyone should see it. I have it on DVD form, and it took such a long time to find it too. That should say something, heh and another thing I will add is that it is quite difficult finding the soundtrack. I believe they stopped it, but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing. It has songs by artists like The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and the Sunshine Band, and many more.&#39;
b&#39;The lovely, yet lethal Alexandra (stunning statuesque blonde beauty Stacie Randall, who looks absolutely smashing in a tight black leather outfit) must find a magic amulet so her evil demonic master Faust can cross over into our dimension. It\&#39;s up to fearless, rugged cop Jonathan Graves (likable Peter Liapis) to stop her. Meanwhile, two pitifully unfunny &#34;comic relief&#34; dwarf gnome creatures run amok in Los Angeles. Seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert Jim Wynorski relates the supremely inane story at a brisk pace and takes none of this foolishness remotely seriously. The cast struggle gamely with the silly material: the adorable Barbara Alyn Woods as sassy, fetching police captain Kate, Raquel Krelle as tart, sexy hooker Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco as Graves\&#39; bumbling, excitable partner Scotty, Peggy Trentini as alluring museum curator Monica, and Ace Mask as the jolly Dr. Rochelle. Mark Stevi\&#39;s puerile cookie cutter script, an amusingly lowbrow sense of no-brainer humor, Chuck Cirino\&#39;s bouncy cornball score, the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber Halloween masks, J.E. Bash\&#39;s plain cinematography, no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of, and the tacky (less than) special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid Velveeta. An entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck.&#39;
b&#34;Visconti&#39;s masterpiece! I admit that I am unfamiliar with much of his work but I cannot imagine his other work surpassing this fabulous film. Last night I watched Death in Venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by all that I saw. This captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements: The extraordinary shots directed by Visconte, primarily his love of long, languorous shots of people dining, swimming, walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people; the cinematographers brilliant interpretation of Visconti&#39;s shot selection; the acting by the principles without over-riding dialog and conveying the scenes complexity through facial features alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true: young people watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film, a film that could not be made in 2006. A film whose time rests in those brief handful of years in the Sixties and early Seventies of the last century when artistic license was passed to film directors and money-men took secondary roles. As many of the recent IMDb commentator&#39;s have written, this film, in their judgment, is long, boring (too little action) and pretentious. I suppose by the standards of Hollywood pap, these comments contain merit. Unfortunately they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, if you have not seen Death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a film and story from another time. You will be rewarded.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Thriller&#34; is brilliant. It is a long video, but simply brilliant nonetheless. The song itself is...excellent...add Michael JAckson dancing and you have a golden Phenomenon. Out of all the videos I have ever seen, this is the best. If you have not seen the video yet, then I urge you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects are amazing for it\&#39;s time... everything from the wearwolf transformation to the idea of these creepy zombies slowly raising from their graves is grand...spookishly grand that is. Vicent Price has his segment of bone-shivering lines...known simply as &#34;the rap&#34; Ola Ray does good as Michael\&#39;s girl, and Michael JAckson himself...the dancing, and singing (although not during the video itself) is unmatched...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10.&#39;
b&#39;Canadian film-maker Ron Switzer delivers a solid, non-stop thrill ride of relentless horror with the superb 1991 sci-fi film &#34;Science Crazed&#34;. A hideous monster takes revenge on his mother, a police officer and tenants of an apartment building. Brilliant practical make-up and special effects designs create a truly terrifying monster, especially when lurking through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment settings. The characters are developed beautifully with outstanding and surprisingly touching performances from an ensemble cast. Produced by Donna Switzer, newcomer Ron Switzer also penned the film\&#39;s face-paced script, weaving together an engaging roller-coaster ride of twists, turns, and terror that keeps you guessing until the last frame. Science Crazed will no doubt leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!&#39;
b&#34;I was extraordinarily impressed by this film. It&#39;s one of the best sports films I&#39;ve every seen. The visuals in this film are outstanding. I love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup. The film moves well, offering both excitement and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting performances are great. I was surprised by young Shia LaBeouf.He does well in this role. Stephen Dillane is also good as the brooding Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth, and Elias Koteas offer able support. The film is gripping and entertaining and for the first time in my life actually made me want to watch a golf tournament.&#34;
b&#39;Although it is more of a kids movie, it still holds its own, especially when compared to the more recent assembly line animated films being made. The music is fantastic!! I don\&#39;t care how old you are, you will still find yourself rockin to &#34;Girls of Rock and Roll&#34; and Diamond Dolls.&#34; Definatly a must for animation lovers.&#39;
b&#39;There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many &#34;bad&#34; epics of the era. many production values, excellent use of color (The De Luxe color was more Brigit and sharp that the ordinary Technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong but in any case, the film did man\xc3\xa8ged to give us idea of the life in ancient Egyptin and was in a way the motor to go out and buy the novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best, if not the best historical-novel ever published. Also oust anding was the superb score by Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann. I saw this film many times when I was a boy, it was not the big box office hit that Fox studios wanted to afther The Robe enormous hit, in CinemaScope and Stereo was a wonderful eye popping sp4ectacle. I have the Lasser Disc version.m the only way to see Ito its wdisescreen format. Soon i Hope will appeared.&#39;
b&#39;This American masterpiece came as near perfection as popular art contrives to be, from its beautifully equivocal and suggestive title to the magnificent performance elicited by William Wyler from the nonprofessional amputee Harold Russell\xc2\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film epitomized both the dream and the reality of the postwar world\xc2\x85 This intimate engagement with the psychological facts of American life gave it an almost universal audience\xc2\x85 But, unlike contemporary and preceding &#34;message&#34; pictures, it was not a preachment\xc2\x85 It showed Americans as they are, presented their problems as they themselves see them, and provided only such solutions\xc2\x97partial, temporary, personal\xc2\x97as they themselves would accept\xc2\x85 The picture\&#39;s values are the values of the people in it\xc2\x85&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Wyler, an outstanding director, triple winner of the best picture Oscar, adds an air of distinction to melodrama, epic and Westerns... With his distinguishing visual style and his taste for solemn material, he gained a reputation as a meticulous, serious artist... Wyler\&#39;s most adept use of deep-focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film tells the story of three men coming home from war to a small middle-American community, and find it variously difficult to pick up where they left off... The three heroes are: a middle-aged sergeant (Fredric March), magnificent as the devoted family man who succeeds in breaking the ice with his family; an incisive Air Force captain (Dana Andrews) returning to an unfaithful wife; and a tormented sailor (Harold Russell) who has lost both hands in service, replaced by hooks in real life...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, &#34;The Best Years of Our Lives&#34; is eloquent and compassionate, a deeply personal motion picture with touching wordless homecoming scenes: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The first words of the sergeant\&#39;s loving wife when he arrives home unexpectedly: &#34;I look terrible! It isn\&#39;t fair of you to burst in on us like this.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The involuntarily sob of the sailor\&#39;s mother when she first sees her son\&#39;s mechanical hands... She blurts out: &#34;It\&#39;s nothing!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her dry-martini voice, Myrna Loy combines charmingly her wifely qualities with motherly ones; Teresa Wright is lovely as the sergeant\&#39;s nice daughter who falls in love with the pilot; Virginia Mayo is harsh as the disloyal flashy blonde wife whose first loves are money and high life; and Cathy O\&#39;Donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the sailor\&#39;s fianc\xc3\xa9e...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The situations and even some of the characters seem a little obvious, but this is a superb example of high-quality film-making in the forties, with smiles and tears cunningly spaced and a film which says what is needed on a vital subject...&#39;
b&#39;Okay, I\&#39;ll say it. This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. This statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film. But the thing that most people don\&#39;t get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy. I mean, did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece? Just look at the &#34;scary&#34; hologram on the jacket of the movie and you\&#39;ll find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which I thought was just as funny), this movie turned out to be a side-splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue, bad one liners and horrible special effects. And it\&#39;s all made to deliver laughter to us viewers. It certainly worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example: Anne Tiler (to her troubled husband): What makes you frown so heavily darling?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that chunk of dialogue doesn\&#39;t make you laugh, then you have serious issues. Who in their right mind would utter those words in real life? Of course, no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous! Just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you\&#39;ll see what\&#39;s so damn funny about Jack Frost 2.&#39;
b&#34;A group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aristocats is regarded as one of Walt Disney&#39;s finest 2D animations with its charming script and cool characters, but it doesn&#39;t quite have the magic that created Snow White or the Jungle Book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry, the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the funniest Disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments, especially involving the Cats and the Dogs. The representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story, after the boring beginning, is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be. There are hardly any lapses and no dull moments. The journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring, not to mention two very strange British swans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Disney, you always get a strong meaningful message. With the Jungle Book it is where you belong, with Beauty and the Beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. However with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing. The film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough; it seems very far fetched and irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister and I found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the Jungle Book cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message, this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to.&#34;
b&#34;So here&#39;s a bit of background on how I came to see this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French film, that was then remade (quelle surprise) by Hollywood as Wicker Park. Well I avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released, simply because, a) I knew it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park, and living in Chicago, I didn&#39;t see why they called it that - it was filmed in fricking Canada for a start! - b) I have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes, done purely because Hollywood thinks we&#39;re too bone idle to read a few subtitles (I am dreading the remake of Infernal Affairs by the way) and c) I can&#39;t stand Josh Hartnett, &#39;nuff said there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I came across WP on TV the other day, probably about half an hour in, and I have to say initially, it made no sense at all, until about half an hour from the end, when it started coming together. By the end, I was really surprised to find myself really into it, and then the ending just seemed so good - a perfect combination of story, passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices I&#39;ve ever seen (heard??).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#39;ve heard a lot about the L&#39;Appartement vs. Wicker Park argument and looking at WP, I still say it has bugger all to do with Chicago, but there seemed something about it that I liked, so when it was on again, I watched it again - unfortunately, still missing the first chunk (I&#39;ve still yet to see it!), and I still thought it was pretty good. Heck, even Josh Hartnett seemed good! But I was curious about L&#39;Appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So I waited and waited to catch l&#39;Appartement somewhere somehow. Netflix let me down, so I ended up getting a copy from some website in Ireland. And I&#39;ve just watched it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s really kind of weird, but a good weird. A classic French film. Great acting, Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she acts Monica Bellucci off the screen in every scene. Vincent Cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works. And I&#39;ve seen Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in a lot of movies and I just love him - the scene where Alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone&#39;s told him his puppy&#39;s been run over was excruciating! But, I can honestly say, having seen WP and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy (as about 75% of the rest of the movie had been - maybe in a different order, but come on, the scene with the coffee in the glasses?? Word for word!!), you can imagine my surprise when I watched the ending of L&#39;Appartement!! I can literally say I was blown away - hmm, a bit like poor old Lucien was through the cafe window really! So, be prepared, if you&#39;ve seen Wicker Park and you fancy taking a look at the original like I did, do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie, because you&#39;ll either be disappointed, or exhilarated at a piece of French movie history - a prime example of how you can watch a movie, think you&#39;re going to watch a pithy happy ending, and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end. Definitely catch this movie. Oh and while you&#39;re at, maybe not too near the same time, but down the road, take a look at Wicker Park, it&#39;ll surprise you too.&#34;
b&#39;10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLOT DISCUSSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best movies ever made and I am not saying that because I am being fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation. Those who dislike the film because they don\&#39;t understand the story often criticize those who are praising the film by saying that they are assuming its genius because they don\&#39;t understand it. I don\&#39;t view this movie as very allegorical. To me, it is a story with a beginning, middle and end. People become confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep, philosophical meaning that they are to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes. I feel they fail to realize that the crypticness comes from a chopped-up and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. Because of the limitation of length, I will try to keep this short and to the point and touch on the major concepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general plot: Diane moves to L.A. after jitterbug contest to get into acting. At an audition, she meets Camilla with whom she falls in love. Diane becomes enraged with jealousy since Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) at a film shoot and discovers the other woman (a random blond) at the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Motivated by her rage and possessiveness, Diane hires a hit man to kill Camilla. After that is done, she is overcome by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants to. Diane is then awakened. In her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The significance of the fantasy: The film starts out, after the credits, with a 1st person p.o.v. shot depicting somebody collapsing onto a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. This is where Diane\&#39;s fantasy starts. The accident is there as an excuse for her to &#34;bring back&#34; her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. She depicts her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wished she was. In the meantime, she acts like everything is &#34;like in the movies&#34; because she has an escapist personality. She also, in a sense, kills herself off and assumes the identity of a waitress named Betty at a diner. The story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in someway victimized in reality just as she was and &#34;convinces&#34; herself that he was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in the fantasy is actually the random blond from the engagement party. She hated her so much that she turned her into Camilla and made the ultimate antagonist. She then took the real Camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive out-of-the-movies girlfriend and used Rita Hayworth as an inspiration. She also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify the survival of Camilla. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diane which ended up being herself and made the dreamworld die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio which chanted that &#34;there is no band&#34; and the &#34;instruments&#34; you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor for the fantasy. She begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings. The other reminder is the blue box... Actually, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more of a Pandora\&#39;s Box, really), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds her of the actual death of Camilla because it is what the hit man said would show up when it was done. Along with having love, this entire creation of hers is an escape from reality by living in the idealized Hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream. It is not series of random things specifically designed to disturb and it is not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate chunk of the human condition that is presented beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, ultimately this is all my opinion. I may be way off. Or it may not be intended to mean any one thing. There are many who disagree with me. Great! Afterall, why does it have to mean anything? Why can\&#39;t it just be a statement in itself? What if coherent, sensible narratives are shackles for artistic expression? Peter Greenaway, for example, has spent many words eloquently supporting that idea by such statements as &#34;I would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don\&#39;t be a film maker. Because I believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren\&#39;t primarily to do with narrative.&#34; And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. &#34;I didn\&#39;t understand it!&#34; So...? &#34;Mulholland Dr.,&#34; story or not, affects the viewers, harasses them, drags them, awes them, lulls them. The way it lends itself to interpretation is amazing. It never gets old. It never loses its luster. Its visuals are always effective and beautiful. It is cinematic perfection no matter what. Enjoy.&#39;
b&#34;What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950&#39;s. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don&#39;t know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don&#39;t think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good! What a difference in the stars from the 50&#39;s to todays music stars. How can you compare someone like Buddy Holly to Justin Timberlake? or any of the other popular singers of this generation?&#34;
b&#34;I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time faves! It&#39;s a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, suspense and shocking twist ending (all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous Monterey/Big Sur coast) never get old. Roy Thinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. The acting is great and believable; viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband, disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger (Thinnes as Brant). I have searched for a copy to buy for years - I guess TV movies don&#39;t get released to video, unfortunately. Great movie, see it if you can find it.&#34;
b&#39;To be completely honest, I completely intrigued by the original concept of \&#39;Sleeper Cell.\&#39; Having watched the best part of the series on FX Channel (UK), my Sky got broke meaning I missed the crucial finale. But what I DID see of it, I assumed it to be a great story line, good acting and as I don\&#39;t watch \&#39;24\&#39; I thought it was great, AND it\&#39;s been confirmed for a second season...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best TV programs I have seen. Much more realistic and believable than &#34;24.&#34; Excellent character development and plot line. Does not bash Islam, but gives a thoughtful and considered approach, showing the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam. Everybody should see this show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stringy xx&#39;
b&#39;Ever wonder where that episode, &#34;Tuttle,&#34; came from in the middle of the first season of M*A*S*H? Well now the cat\&#39;s out of the bag: they got it from this Soviet film, a satire on how dumb the Tsar is, due to the slip of a pen (rendering the phrase &#34;the Lieutenants, though ...&#34; into &#34;Lieutenant Kizhe&#34; which has no meaning) and nobody being honest or gutsy enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth -- Kizhe doesn\&#39;t exist and never did. So they make up an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him off. And 40 years later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly borrowed this zany plot and gave us essentially the same story, only on the other side of what had become the Cold War, proving that people in high positions can be equally dumb no matter what their loyalties may be!&#39;
b&#34;It gives the ordinary guy/girl the chance to be on television singing as their favourite stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the majority of the time, they sound like the singer they are meant to be portraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another twist to it - A team of make up people and costumers dress the contestant up like that singer. They might not look like them but the likelihood of getting someone that sounds like a person looking exactly the same as them are very slim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a load of fun for your Saturday night - and the contestants aren&#39;t raging wannabes like they are on another TV singing show. The fact that there are no prizes involved and it is for fun means that it will attract a different type of person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe i have is with the Kids version - it looks like they have done the round of stage schools- what happened to the normal kids?&#34;
b&#39;&#34;What Alice Found&#34; was a pleasant discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, this is combination of a road movie with a cautionary tale, as well as a voyage of discovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven\&#39;t seen the film, maybe you should stop reading here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice is a case study of a young woman that wants to break away from the unhappy life she leads in a New England town. Her pretext for leaving is going to join her best friend, who is away studying at a Miami university. Alice is the product of a single mother\&#39;s home, one that is struggling to make ends meet, in sharp contrast with the life of ease her friend seems to inhabit. In flashbacks we get to see Alice\&#39;s life before going on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice, like her namesake in &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34;, embarks in a trip to the unknown that life hasn\&#39;t prepared her for. The highways of America are full of predators in search of the weak and innocent. Alice meets with disaster when her car breaks down the road and a friendly Southern couple come to her assistance when a strange man approaches in the darkness with the excuse he wants to help her. Sandra and Bill convince her to come along in their plush R.V. on her way down South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has prepared Alice for what this couple turns out to be. After all, in her sheltered life, she hasn\&#39;t dealt with what Sandra and Bill, her new benefactors do during the overnight stays at the rest stops in the American highways. It comes as a shock to her the realization that the kind Sandra is nothing but a prostitute that plies her trade among the truck driving populace one meets in those places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice, brilliantly played by Emily Grace, is a study in how the young woman awakens to the new reality she can\&#39;t escape. In fact, Sandra makes it seem so easy that Alice tries her luck at the oldest profession on earth in order to raise some badly needed money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judith Ivey gives a tremendous performance as Sandra. Ms. Ivey is perfect as the seemingly normal woman, one wouldn\&#39;t suspect she is doing the nasty with clients she and Bill find along the route they travel. Ms. Ivey is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an accusing Alice. As the husband, Bill Raymond is good in his portrayal as the husband, that in reality is a procurer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the excellent direction of Mr. Dean Bell, the film is not afraid to go to places mainstream films dare not to go. Congratulations to this director who has written a plausible story and has gathered the perfect cast to play it for our benefit.&#39;
b&#34;When it was released, in the beginning of the 80&#39;s, Pixote brings to Brazilian society the problems of young delinquents, and the impact of this in Brazilian society. I can&#39;t watch the movie at that time, cause I was too young, but now I got a chance and watched It a few days ago. It&#39;s a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true, and sad. pixote is the name of a 12 year-old boy who lives in the streets, and survive with misdemeanors; he stays for a while in a house of detention, and when he left it he continues to plan robs with other buns and a prostitute, played by marilia Pera. the boy is still a marijuana addicted and smell glue with another teenagers, to forget his sad reality. the quality of the images it&#39;s not the best, but the movie is totally realistic about Brazilian problems, and must be viewed and admired.&#34;
b&#34;This movie is simply awesome. It is so hilarious. Although the skating and other montages are played out, the comedy is awesome. Raab Himself and Brandon Dicamillo are hilarious. There will be moments when you can&#39;t breath you&#39;re laughing so hard. Plus, there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;
b&#39;The Diary of Anne Frank is the second best-selling nonfiction book in the world, and for good reason. Nonetheless, sitting through this documentary about her life, which fills in some of the details where the diary left off, I thought, &#34;Just another documentary about Anne Frank.&#34; I found it to be competent but not extraordinary. That was my complacent attitude because I was already well aware of the story of Anne Frank; most of what the documentary had to tell me wasn\&#39;t news to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything changed, though, when I got to the end of the documentary---when I saw the motion picture footage of Anne Frank. The emotional impact of seeing this footage, only a second or so long, made everything that came before it a thousand times more real---but not just everything that was in the documentary; everything I had previously known about Anne Frank suddenly became more real to me, more personal. I\&#39;d always been moved by her story, but when I saw that footage, what I felt was stronger and deeper and more profound than any other film experience of my life. (I knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of Anne Frank, and I\&#39;d even seen the footage in a movie review on television, but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience. It\&#39;s not likely that my mentioning it here will spoil it for anyone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize now that many people still don\&#39;t know the story of Anne Frank; it\&#39;s discouraging at times to be witness to this kind of ignorance. I think to myself, &#34;How could someone NOT know the story of Anne Frank?&#34; This being the case, though, ANNE FRANK: REMEMBERED, along with reading her diary, is the best place to start. It\&#39;s a story that everyone should know.&#39;
b&#34;Just reading the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini series reminded me how much I enjoyed this when it was first broadcast many years ago. At the time I remember waiting with anticipation for the next installment and fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer ,two talented actors that we don&#39;t see enough of on TV or cinema these days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried without success to obtain several of the BBCs fantastic dramas from the past, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne of Green Gables, all wonderful timeless classic stories, which sadly the BBC seem to have no intention of releasing on video or DVD. If anyone learns otherwise I would love to hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime we will have to content ourselves with our recollections of how wonderful they were.&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;ve never seen a show with as much story, mystery, suspense, and hard-hitting excitement before. i barley watch TV anymore but i own every season of this show and it&#39;s amazing. every episode is extremely well-acted, written and plotted. towards the end of the show i felt that the stories were getting too far-fetched for being in a prison, but the actors pulled it off. Sopranoes sucks huge compared to OZ. in fact, any show that is on a cable network, HBO or not just cant hold a candle to OZ. i wish it would come back for one more season. if it did happen, they would probably kill off every character on the show, but hey, we all gotta go sometime. as far as the characters, i&#39;d say O&#39;Reily and Alverez were my favorites. both were hardley in a scene together, but their individual stories i thought were the strongest of anyones, except Beechers of course, but still... anyway, best show ever, best network ever, some of the best actors ever, PERIOD!&#34;

b&#34;Recap: Not entirely familiar with the Shakespeare story of Macbeth, but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original, only set in present time. It tells the story of Macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a valued hit-man and in the favor of leader Duncan. But he and his lady has higher ambitions than that, and plan the murder of Duncan, and any competition of the throne. This is a story of betrayal and cold, brutal death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments: Very interesting idea, I must say. To use the story but change the setting to present time, but still keep the original (?) dialog. It sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence. Promised to be extremely violent, it is a promise that it keeps, but not in the notion I imagined. It is very bloody indeed, but the violence is slow. Not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated, which it is too, but also literally. A lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could have been a unique strength, the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence, now turns into something else entirely. Now both slow the move down painfully much, so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I can&#39;t figure out the context the three witches act within. Set to present time and reality I figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie. Apparently it does, but to me it seems completely out of place. Not a subplot but a complete sub-story with it&#39;s own rules, completely different than the rest of the movie. Seems completely out of place. Surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern. Drug-induced hallucinations perhaps (which I suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable)? Now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and I just waited for the real movie to begin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A clear disappointment, but maybe something for Shakespearean-buffs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#34;
b&#39;I first heard of this movie at the &#34;Flashback Weekend&#34; in Chicago 2007 for the &#34;Nightmare on Elm Street&#34;. Robert Englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of &#34;Hatchet&#34;. The same can be said for Tony Todd. Knowing this is a low budget first time director / writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden &#34;Holloween&#34; (2007) remake/re-imagining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically it falls short in a couple of places. The alligator attack seen was shoot too dark. When it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp clamping on to the black pants became almost invisible. The mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned, like a bad sitcom. And just like &#34;Holloween&#34; (2007) someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer. The ending, well, as soon as I saw where it was going I knew what was going to happen, not very original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions. Unlike &#34;Holloween&#34; (2007) we got to meet the people and care what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the lead of &#34;Spiral&#34;)the sulking lead and Marcus (&#34;Not Another Teen Movie&#34;)as the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie. Shapiro (Joel Murry &#34;Dharma &amp; Greg&#34;), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab of &#34;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series&#34;, &#34;Angel: The Series&#34; and &#34;The Addams Family&#34; movies) give a convoluted reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo played by television regulars (Richard Riehle &#34;Grounded for Life&#34;, Patrika Darbo &#34;Step by Step&#34;)as the older couple that you know don\&#39;t stand a chance, even the tour guide Shawn (Parry Shen) is a fleshed out character. I hope to see more from all involved in this film, but I think it will play better on home video than in the theater, sorry.&#39;
b&#34;Maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because I walked out well before the end. That&#39;s odd, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummers Night&#39;s Dream once, many years ago, when I saw it on the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the Shakespearian name, Calista Flockhart, and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. Well, I suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren&#39;t, I&#39;d say we have a bad movie on our hands....&#34;
b&#34;Apparently, in the eyes of some - there aren&#39;t enough horror films these days involving young people being chased across a desert by a mysterious, bloodthirsty madman in a truck. I mean, all we have so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man - among others. REST STOP may very well be the worst out of those. It is about a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives behind to start over together in California. Along the way, they stop at a grimy lavatory so the young lady can relieve herself, but when she returns - she finds that her boyfriend and his car are gone. From there, she learns that the culprit is a guy driving a yellow pickup who proceeds to stalk and terrorize her as she hides in the restrooms. This movie is so unoriginal that it is flat out boring. The acting is annoying, the gore is mild, and the killer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the entire movie, is anything but memorable. Terrible - terrible film...&#34;
b&#39;Drab, dreary and a total waste of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so don\&#39;t think about it too much). The acting is odd and wooden - I would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting, but that might be an insult to body builders. There are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster, but lots of fires, explosions, a gratuitous sex scene, etc. The only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the US and Iraq that somehow goes nuclear...hmmm. Is Roger Corman psychic? Let\&#39;s hope that &#34;Iraq&#34; was just a lucky choice for Corman and that the rest of his scenario doesn\&#39;t come true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#34;I have neither read the book on which the movie is based, nor the letters between Vita and Violet. If I came to this movie with any expectations whatsoever, it was maybe that the Bloomsbury group (including among others Virginia Woolf, and which the Nicolsons were part of) would be depicted. It wasn&#39;t, which however wasn&#39;t a problem for me. What I am wondering about is how the people behind this movie managed to make it, in my opinion, so very uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characters flat, in spite of great material and some very good actors. The script is simply not good enough. I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor - too many pointless sex scenes (but only between the women, while there is nothing explicit whatsoever concerning Harold&#39;s numerous love affairs), too many pointless scenes in general, too little information about the background of characters. It seems odd considering the quality of the production - on the surface it seems a really ambitious piece of work, but the script holds of course the most weight and that is where this movie fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vita&#39;s relationship with Harold struck me as unconvincing, although both of them act really well, especially her. The way they kept declaring their unconditional love for each other in a rather sappy manner I thought, well, simply unconvincing. It makes a lot more sense that it should have happened through letters, as tmmvds points out I would also have liked to know where the nicknames came from - the Russian ones* as well as Mar - why ever is someone called Vita given the nickname Mar? It might be small stuff, but it matters in contributing to the bigger picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I watched the movie with English subtitles on, and where it should apparently have said Mitya, it said instead Medea. That might explain my frustration with the nicknames to some extent - I could not understand why Vita&#39;s should be Greek while Violet&#39;s was Russian!&#34;
b&#39;This episode had potential. The basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. And when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. But stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. &#34;It\&#39;s funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind;&#34; &#34;This door has serious damage to it that wasn\&#39;t here a minute ago;&#34; &#34;The door opened by itself, without me touching it;&#34; etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn\&#39;t she take some precaution before entering it? Maybe she could investigate in the day time. Or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. Or maybe she could TURN ON THE LIGHTS!!! Also, while in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. JUST UNPLUG THE PHONE! The phone company doesn\&#39;t need to be involved. Walk up to the phone and unplug it. Case closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, showing the phone scamper across the floor like it\&#39;s alive was just comical. If the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card, he could\&#39;ve done it in a way that didn\&#39;t look cartoony. Brave Little Toaster anyone?&#39;
b&#39;I did my best to watch this two hour fiasco. It combined the awful special effects and plot of the original &#34;Blob,&#34; with an execrable boosting of the (outstanding in the original) screenplay of &#34;Runaway Train.&#34; The only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured they\&#39;d combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch. What an incredible stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part, no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a typecast creep, a U.S. Senator from Texas and plays it well. He should next do the lead role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the Fay Wray Memorial screaming contest. Special effects are unbelievably bad. H.S. kids in film class in North Dakota could have done a better job. The writers must have pulled a heist at the clich\xc3\xa9 bank to accumulate this many. I couldn\&#39;t watch any more without being forced to sit in the Clockwork Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended, except obviously, 119 minutes too late. Ugh! Caveat emptor.&#39;
b&#39;First off, the first thing that came to my mind after I finished this film last night was &#34;Why the title of 8MM 2?&#34;, because I saw the first one obviously, and what did this have to do with the first movie\&#39;s plot? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasn\&#39;t even needed in the plot, because after you see the ending that I will not spoil, it just didn\&#39;t make any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diplomat and his fianc\xc3\xa9e are in Hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area, she\&#39;s very attractive, so when they see her at a club, they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome. But things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair, fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career, they pay off the guy who sent the pictures, the diplomat freaks out and &#34;kills&#34; the guy, leading into a murder case. He and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with, but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could have been an alright thriller, turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie, which was sad. Like I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first one, so don\&#39;t fall for it. It\&#39;s just a sexual thriller that makes no sense, but it\&#39;s good for those nights alone, because quite frankly this is one of those films where it\&#39;s so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#39;
b&#39;There were nice characters in here, played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses, plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers.....yet the film just didn\&#39;t work. By the time this was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialog was dumb, the humor (mainly Milton Berle\&#39;s) was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve never been a big-band fan, anyway, and if I hear &#34;In The Mood&#34; one more time I\&#39;ll puke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first look at famous skater-actor Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her. Almost part of the problem, at least with the humor, is that it\&#39;s so dated it isn\&#39;t funny anymore. Berle, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abbot &amp; Costello, etc. etc. were hilarious to the crowds in the 40s and 50s but humor changes, and what was funny back then is not today.&#39;
b&#34;A previous IMDb reviewer has stated that &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; is a &#39;rip-off&#39; (that&#39;s the other reviewer&#39;s term) of a German musical called &#39;Me By Day, You By Night&#39;. Apparently that reviewer is unaware that *both* of these films have borrowed their premise from &#39;Box and Cox&#39;, an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady, each man believing himself the sole tenant. Because the two men have different work schedules, the ruse is not discovered straight away. This play was once so popular in Britain that &#39;to Box and Cox it&#39; became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The innovation of &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman, who inevitably develop a romance. As is usual in these cornball movies, the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each other&#39;s arms. Hoo boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The landlord in this film is played by George Sidney, a character actor who specialised in playing Jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic. George Sidney was never as annoying as the odious Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit) but Sidney&#39;s depictions of Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single most notable thing about &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; is that, to my knowledge, this is the earliest Hollywood film to make reference to Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At one point in this movie, landlord Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers his teenage son Julius engaged in chalking swastikas on the walls. Eckbaum and his son are clearly meant to be Jewish. Admittedly, nobody in Hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what Hitler was planning for the Jews in Europe ... still, it&#39;s surprising to see a film depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke. His father is, quite properly, angered by this display of the Nazi symbol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich as late as 1939. Hollywood&#39;s leading ladies were medically documented as &#39;Aryan&#39; so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood&#39;s leading men were documented as &#39;Aryan and uncircumcised&#39;. Except for Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox, all the Hollywood studio executives who colluded in this policy were Jewish ... but clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler. I&#39;m surprised that &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably, as this sequence would have rendered the film Verboten in Germany and Austria. (Maybe the scene was cut out for German release: it isn&#39;t crucial to the movie&#39;s plot.) Apart from this, the movie contains nothing notable. Robert Benchley does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation: I&#39;ve never understood the appeal of this man. I&#39;ll rate &#39;Rafter Romance&#39; 4 out of 10.&#34;
b&#34;spoilers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is not action packed; it&#39;s slow and boring. It&#39;s not funny or exciting, it&#39;s predictable and plays on cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism. The special effects are not imaginative or impressive. They are noisy and uninspired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid one-liners and clich\xc3\xa9s. These are spouted by characters they ought to just be called `gentle giant black man,&#39; `eccentric genius who is about to crack,&#39; `square jawed hero coming of age,&#39; `by-the-book coward,&#39; `luckless gambler who lives by a code of honor,&#39; `impulsive princess&#39; and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the writing! How many undramatic countdowns did they think they could fit in this thing? Does a scene where people have to defuse a bomb by cutting one or another wire even count as fiction anymore? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the movie depends on the audience caring if some jerk can put aside his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say bye bye to Liv Tyler in time TO SAVE THE EARTH. All the work is done; we just have to wait a couple more seconds for Harry Stamper, the jerk, to toss off a few cotton candy lines. I know Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his Harry Stamper character is an obnoxious bore. I thought he earned the Golden Razzy he was awarded for this role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the movie is so long, the plot so obvious, and the dialogue so disposable, one can&#39;t help but notice the lame inaccuracies, inconsistencies and plot holes. 800 feet into something the size of TX is less than a pinprick. Try walking 800 feet into TX and see how close to the center you are. After all the discussion about the artificial gravity on the Russian station, it appears to be arbitrary once inside. Actually, gravity comes and goes throughout the movie. Does it make any sense that anyone besides Michael Bay would give these morons a couple shuttles and send them to blow up an asteroid threatening the earth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sentimental phone/insurance/cola commercial style montages were revolting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like action movies. Really. This one is boring, stupid and really stuck on itself. It deserves hatred and scorn because it&#39;s everything Hollywood&#39;s most expensive efforts have become - a bunch of cheap cliches running from one expensive explosion to another. Oh yes, the whole thing is permeated by a Neanderthal conservative outlook on sex, politics and so on.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Problem Child&#34; was an okay movie, but did it really merit a sequel? I don\&#39;t think it did. The original movie\&#39;s only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn\&#39;t even good in this sequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t really put my finger on why this movie was bad. For starters, it just wasn\&#39;t funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I didn\&#39;t sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue. He appeared to hate every woman that his father Ben (John Ritter) dated for the sole sake of hating them. It also doesn\&#39;t send a good message to kids with divorced parents (who constitute over half children in the U.S. these days) when the one woman Ben decides to (almost) marry is a Southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as cool as I thought it would have been to see original SNL cast mate Laraine Newman come back to the big screen, she couldn\&#39;t even save this movie. I also found it strange that she was a white Southern d\xc3\xa9butante whose name was Lawanda. That sounds more like an African-American woman\&#39;s name. But of course, that has nothing to do with why I disliked this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the movie didn\&#39;t work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate, along with protagonists you weren\&#39;t supposed to hate. John Ritter\&#39;s character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting. Instead, he came off not only as a wimpy parent, but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days, regardless of how well he knew the woman. Did I mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included Amy Yasbeck unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character, that young girl who was even more obnoxious than Junior, completely uncalled for toilet humor, and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (involving the dog catchers). The movie was just a mess, and really doesn\&#39;t deserve a DVD release if it hasn\&#39;t been given one already. It should just rot on VHS along with all the other bad, forgettable 90\&#39;s comedies.&#39;
b&#39;Considering the subject matter, I thought that this film would at least be enjoyable, if stopping somewhat short of a masterpiece. I was wrong. I was still waiting for something to happen and it finished - I thought that the finale was the bit that happened before it got exciting. The only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition.&#39;
b&#34;Stodgy drama starring Pat O&#39;Brien as a washed-up reporter who turns up at his ex-boss&#39;s house to ask for money to fund his son&#39;s operation, only to find him dead on the floor. Since O&#39;Brien knows the identity of the culprit, he offers to take the rap in return for the money he needs. A decent premise is wasted on a film that pretends it has surprises, twists and turns, even though it really doesn&#39;t. Performances are rotten across the board, the movie dresses itself up as a hard-boiled American noir but the mix of dodgy accents doesn&#39;t work, and the story is hardly gripping. And it contains possibly the least attractive screen kiss of all time.&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;m not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I found it pretty comical. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna&#39; fix that. Part exorcism and part soap opera, you&#39;ll at least get some laughs. There&#39;s the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, Valley of the Dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear Isobel. It sometimes felt like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see this. Instead of the cool head-twisting, sailor cursing, and crucifix humping that Regan did in The Exorcist; you get a lot of Isobel bouncing on her bed like it&#39;s a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. Yeah, it&#39;s Chuck E. Cheese gone wild. So, if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending ... this is your movie.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Riders of Destiny&#34; was the first of several westerns Wayne made for the Lone Star arm of Monogram Pictures between 1933 and 1935. In this entry, the producers try to make the Duke into a singing cowboy called &#34;Singin\&#39; Sandy Saunders with hilarious results. Any Wayne fan knows that the Duke couldn\&#39;t have carried a tune if his life had depended on it. His voice was apparently dubbed by Smith Ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like Wayne. Wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in &#34;performing&#34; the musical numbers. Thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the movie itself, it contains a standard &#34;B&#34; western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local ranchers. Duke, of course plays the hero. He had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also cast in the film were George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as the heroine\&#39;s father, Cecilia Parker as the heroine and Yakima Canutt as &#34;one of the boys&#34; who performs his &#34;falling from the racing horses under the wagon&#34; stunt while doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes would go on to appear with Wayne in most of the other entries in the series. Canutt, in particular would have a profound effect on Wayne\&#39;s future development teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and look comfortable on a horse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &#34;B&#34; westerns go this one isn\&#39;t too bad, however, I have to give it a failing grade because of the &#34;singing&#34;.&#39;
b&#39;After starting watching the re-runs of old Columbo movies, I thought they would all get about the same vote from me (6). But apparently I\&#39;m now starting to see differences in the movies. It happened in some of just previous episodes, that showed some pretty genius directing, and it shows in this one, but in the negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away. The directing seems too pretentious. The scenes with the &#34;oh-so-mature&#34; neighbour-girl are a misplace. And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode. Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some applause should be given to the &#34;prelude&#34; however. In this episode, a lot of focus is given on how the murderer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence etc. I really liked that. But alas, no focus on how Columbo reveals all this. And the &#34;proof&#34; that in the end leaves Columbo victorious is the silliest ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: lies between 4 and 5&#39;
b&#34;I gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far, the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. This movie was made in 2003 and I&#39;ve seen movies made in the 60&#39;s with better special effects. I wish I could go into detail, but words can&#39;t describe how crappy this movie was. I could have done better with a home video camera and $20! I pray that Chuck Norris never makes a movie again. Now If you think I&#39;m downing this movie because it has a Christian theme, you&#39;re wrong. I like the fact that IL&#39; Chuck decided to make a movie that at least attempted to make God look good, but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a crappy movie? This whole film can be summed up in 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.&#34;
b&#34;Plot: None. Script: A string of cliches. Acting: Not in evidence. Special effects: Title sequence kind of cool, but otherwise exceptionally poor. Fright factor: Crossing the road is scarier. Cult factor: Only the most desperate cult would latch onto this dog. Can&#39;t you say anything positive: I did. The titles were kind of cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Special bonus question ... your idea of hell: Being at a party with people who voted this flop a 7.)&#34;
b&#39;Before I saw this masterpiece I never would have guessed that a devastating and hideously contagious virus could be defeated by the use of Lutheran prayers... and &#34;erbs&#34;. Ralf Moeller\&#39;s performance is gargantuan; the realism incandescent. I was so inspired I\&#39;m flying straight to Zambibwia tomorrow to crack out the pesto and get my hands together for third world prosperity. God bless this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I\&#39;m going to have to watch Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty just to believe that it is possible to concoct more hamfistedly clich\xc3\xa9d dialogue. It\&#39;s so tortured that taking a cheesegrater to your knuckles might well be preferable to sitting through it. The only subtlety it manages to achieve is in its thinly disguised racism, as the poor islanders turn to ineffectual dumb-ass collective prayer which achieves nothing until the \xc3\xbcbermenschlich, linen-shrouded Teutonic hero Moeller, with his direct line to Yahweh, can provide a blood sample which the horn-blowing yankee scientists can get to work on and save the hapless natives. This movie sucks.&#39;
b&#39;I cannot believe I sat through this utter waste of time. I was just too fascinated by how unspeakably bad it was that I couldn\&#39;t move. It reminded me of the feeling when you can\&#39;t take your eyes away from a horrible car crash or the rotting carcass of a cow. You can\&#39;t help but look, but you feel sick and nauseated afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me elaborate: &#34;Plan 9 from outer space&#34;, for instance, is not a bad movie. Not even &#34;Star Wars: Holiday Special&#34; is a bad movie. They both are awful to watch, for sure, but they both have SOME qualities and at least they leave you the strength to reach for the &#34;off&#34;-button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &#34;remake&#34; (in name only) of the sci-fi classic left me weeping on my couch, desperately trying to come to terms with why such scripts get filmed, why anyone would soil the memory of the original classic, and whether or not I could resume my normal life without my suddenly acquired longing for the quiet and peace of death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although death, I realized, would offer no rest from the horrid memories of this pile of crap, as the poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch it over and over again for eternity...&#39;
b&#34;Unfortunately, this movie is absolutely terrible. It&#39;s not even laughably bad, just plain bad. The actors do their best with what is the cheesiest script ever. How scary can a movie be when the climax actually involves a roomful of millions of styrofoam peanuts?&#34;
b&#34;When I first saw it 9 years ago, when I was 9. I thought it stunk. I&#39;m 18 now and I still think it stinks. I mean geez no Special effects or anything, it was boring and kinda anti-climatic. My cousin watched once and George Takai (Sulu) kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better, but they kept cutting to the budget. It would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.&#34;
b&#34;If I could have given this film 0/10 I would, and this is the first film I have wanted to rate so low. Its worse than awful. If I went to see it in the cinema I would want the cinema to pay ME for watching it (at least minimum wage). Some of the camera shots were quite effective, but a lot were rubbish eg. villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders side-ways from his body (seeing is believing). Several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions/facial expressions when they were shot. I only watched it to the end (fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue) hoping to see Seagal in some decent hand to hand combat, but there was almost none of that (should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music - end of &#39;action&#39; scene). In one scene we see Seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact). The chief villain keeps coming back to life. He gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions. The 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd/3rd floor onto the street. To sum up, this film is a total waste of time and a total joke. It looks very low budget (even for Seagal). The colour is dull and grey. I could go on and on....just like this film, but I wont. Watch this film if you&#39;ve got insomnia. Its guaranteed to put you to sleep.&#34;
b&#39;Sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim, well in this case it was. I believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny, I think I chuckled once when Johnny Vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living, each of them has a problem with their sex lives; Dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before, Ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object, Tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and Jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to &#34;I don\&#39;t believe that anybody could write that&#34; an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash, then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma. The blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers, the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but I didn\&#39;t think their acting was all that bad... not that it was all that good either. Surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly wouldn\&#39;t recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film, I suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates.&#39;
b&#34;In this movie everything possible was wrong and I don&#39;t know why I bothered watching it until the end. It would have been more fun watching paint dry. For crying out loud I even liked D-Tox and it was much better than this. Here is the basic plot for you: A redneck gets bitten by snakes that hold the evil of 13 murderers and becomes an undead killing machine murdering teenagers that have zero personality. During the movie I lost hope when it didn&#39;t scare me at all, when the kills were bad and there was BAD CGI blood and CGI snakes. It got worse with the cardboard thin characters killing their friend by holding her from her legs and not letting go so she got impaled by a tree and when the bad guy moved under water like the shark in Jaws. I&#39;m still upset why I even bothered with this. I guess because I&#39;m a horror movie fan.&#34;
b&#39;This is just a very bad film. Miles looks as if she is in pain during the sex scenes and the acting is wooden. It also drags on slowly and never really finds a point to it all. One of the worst films that I have ever seen!&#39;
b&#39;Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was appalled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT take kids to see this movie. The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they\&#39;ll be bored and disappointed. Certainly *we all* have read Theo\&#39;s wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would\&#39;ve never given his &#34;thumbs up&#34; at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a pity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program. This movie is NOT worth a &#34;free&#34; ticket viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the book. The tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money...seriously. SAVE your money - it will be on cable by saint patty\&#39;s day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame shame shame on what they do!!&#39;
b&#39;So im not a big fan of Boll\&#39;s work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how he\&#39;s not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don\&#39;t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making Genetically-Mutated-soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of &#34;SPOILER&#34; Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. We haven\&#39;t even gone FAR before I started to CRY (mehehe) I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (that\&#39;s poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he\&#39;s on screen.&#39;
b&#34;A pointless cash-in with nothing to contribute except nastiness, this is a definite case of sloppy seconds for Robocop. Irvin Kershner&#39;s numbing, plot less and tired mess of a sequel is watchable and even mildly entertaining in a dubious, unpleasantly trashy way, but it has virtually none of the original&#39;s flair, emotion, intelligence or excitement. Instead we have just another empty spectacle of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to nauseate the viewer with relentless violence, which is far more brainlessly gratuitous than anything in the original. Omni Consumer Products, who made the original Robocop cyborg, have turned into more of a totalitarian force than ever second time round, what with the suspicious Nazi-esquire banners, stormtrooper guards and tanks for hire at the end; as for the anonymous Old Man (Daniel O&#39; Herlihy), he&#39;s less of a benevolent protector and more of a hideous Mr. Burns type, surrounding himself with moronic lackeys who genuinely believe that putting the brain of a murderous psychopath into the body of the all-new Robocop 2 is a good idea. Oh, and the first Robocop gets a look in somewhere amidst all of this mess, though you wonder what on Earth a fine actor like Peter Weller saw in the script. The droll Tom Noonan has nothing to work with as the villain, while Nancy Allen is badly wasted as Robocop&#39;s partner. There are some hilarious moments throughout; the opening &#39;Magnavolt&#39; commercial, for instance, but this is a poor follow-up to the truly great original.&#34;
b&#34;This movie was obscenely obvious and predictable. The scenes were poorly written and acted even worse. Following the horrible scenes was the terrible script filled with pointless and poorly thought out lines. I would never suggest this movie to anyone who would have any sense in watching decent movies. This movie was not only with the same ideas as the show the Bachelor and Bachelorette but also contained many parts in which you would know what the next move and line was going to be without ever having to watched the movie before. The casting was fine but the actors played there characters horribly with more drama then should have been used and said lines in was that wanted you to change the channel quickly. As a note please don&#39;t watch this movie.&#34;
b&#34;I usually like these dumb/no brain activity movies, but this was just too stupid. There were way too many clich\xc3\xa9s and the plot didn&#39;t really make much sense. There were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt. We didn&#39;t even get too see if the big master plan worked. We only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther, the professor (that died because of stupidity (see below)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One scene annoyed me particularly. Why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam? And if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes worth of oxygen, why didn&#39;t he bring two or three of them? Then he would have survived\xc2\x85 that was bloody stupid. The movie is pretty full of such stupid things. I can not recommend it at all.&#34;
b&#39;I went out of my way to get this film, and was fortunate to get it on VHS. Being a big Gloria Grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Other than that, I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her, as I do), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot. She works in a dive, so let her use her own voice. It can only lend to the atmosphere. I must agree with an earlier reviewer; the ending borrows heavily from THE BIG HEAT. To the point of detracting from the ending. I have seen worse films with Ms. Grahame (MACAO), but I will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen. If you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. Enjoy the picture.&#39;
b&#39;Why you ask does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the almighty? Well its deductive logic my friends, you see I know God exists because Satan does, how else would my poor eyes have been soiled on such a horrendous film? Yes there is no doubt about it, on a cold Friday in the year 2006 Satan possessed me and forced me to watch this film. He what? You wonder; the devil makes little girls spit up vomit and climb ceilings, why would he waste his time in making you watch this film? My only conclusion to that query is that Satan believes watching Camp Fear is the worst form of mortal punishment, not gouging out your eyes or making you speak in tongues, instead making you sit mindlessly through one and half hours of the most awful film making ever. Can this film be as terrible as he says? Yes my friend watching this film is the equivalent of getting kicked in the sack about fifty million times, maybe more. But maybe I am being too harsh, this film does have a few moments in it, the beginning for example, starts in a sorority house with a lot of topless girls; now never being in a sorority I am unsure if girls really do this, but hey one can always pray. Now after the five minutes of boobs and butt cheeks has ended we are presented with a scene on campus at an all girls college; the girls themselves (about eight in all) are in an archaeological class, where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds. Flash forward the professor of the class (who happens to be the only male at this girls college apparently) takes a handful of his nubile students, plus girlfriend, to a remote lake in the mountains, their quests, to find ancient Indian artifacts; yeah right professor, we know what angle your pitching. Now this is where the movie gets going, the group of five, four girls, one guy stops at a gas station to get some directions, but lo and behold a biker gang pulls up and harasses the girls, only to eventually leave them alone and go their separate ways. Moving on they get to a &#34;campsite&#34; consisting of four logs and some trees and then things start to go horribly wrong. First the prof. and his girlfriend go wandering away to have some alone time when one of the girls takes it upon herself to find them, only to be captured by some unknown force. Continuing on the other two girls begin searching for the missing girl when the bikers, plus one drunk guy, come looking for them, their plan, to rape the girls and do horrible things to them. The movie goes on with something about a druid needing four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from some kind of water monster before the year two thousand; but their is a hitch to this plan Mr. Druid, one of the girls is devirginized right before us, so away goes that plan. Now since I said there would be spoilers I\&#39;ll go ahead and ruin the end of the movie for you, the four girls get taken, drugged with some green goo and then are ready to be sacrificed, after one of them is killed the two remaining bikers and the prof. come to save them; they stand upon a ledge where the not lead biker says, &#34;I think I can make it down there!&#34; only to leap down and break his leg. The prof. runs at the guy and gets subdued only leaving the once rape-minded-now-heroic biker left to fend off the 6\&#39;3&#34; giant druid. First he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick then pulls a knife, the knife reflects some lazer beam within a gold snakes mouth and lights the druid on fire instantaneously. Afterwords they carry the wounded away via emergency stick stretchers and ponder if everything is really over, only to have the lake bubble showing the monster within it still lives. In a nutshell that is the film and this is my review, which unfortunately will go unread by most eyes since this is only the fifth posted review for a film that has been out for fifteen years. Thankfully Satan can only get to some of us and not all. The Judge would like to make one heartfelt apology to the poor girl at Circuit City I am going to let borrow this movie; &#34;I\&#39;m sorry Sheila, please don\&#39;t hate me for letting you watch this.&#34;&#39;
b&#39;After a good start, it turned out to be the worst piece of holier than thou propaganda i\&#39;ve ever seen. This movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the &#34;holy bible&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To resume the...OK let\&#39;s call it a plot... Basically alien don\&#39;t abduct people (that we already know..). No, in fact its demonic forces abducting people which are in new age stuff or witchcraft, or read porno magazine (as one protagonist does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s complete with the little emotional piano music when the lead character realize he must blindly follow Christ to be saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a quote sums it all , imagine a subtle piano music in the background : &#34;You can\&#39;t let others, even those you love, stop you from following the Lord..&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and we are supposed to live in an enlightened age...still work to do. Boycott this piece of crap&#39;
b&#39;it\&#39;s embarrassing I had like 3 minutes on my way to a job to stop at the video store and it was 2 for 1 night and I was really intrigued by the half nekkid pic of the \&#39;star\&#39;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this film shows what the new york film school and sir daddy\&#39;s fortune - judging by the bio of this clown in the lead - can do for you and you and you cause that\&#39;s about what we have here and in addition a photoshopped pic of the lead &#34;actor&#34; with someone else\&#39;s body in a still image that doesn\&#39;t happen anywhere in the movie. it\&#39;s weird cause in so many ways it had money thrown at it obviously low budget money buckets but from the outset when all the extras are laughing in their scene of terror it doesn\&#39;t bode well would have maybe had some charm if it had been done for 2 cents! in short order I skipped scenes and fast forwarded to see the image on the box that was all I really cared about. strange, why don\&#39;t I just rent a porno or something? but wow there is bad acting that\&#39;s funny I guess and bad acting that\&#39;s just bad. robert englund is pretty pathetic in this along with everyone else. it does make you appreciate the more not so straight to video horror that\&#39;s out there. . . blah most of which I wouldn\&#39;t bother with. shoulda watched uh hellraiser 3 if I wanted to see an 8 pack! I would imagine horny old gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store are going to be the principle renters of this and they ought to start a class action suit!&#39;
b&#39;This &#34;film,&#34; and I use that term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote, at eighteen months: &#34;P.U., stinky poopies!&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like that joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature, or the very stupid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, there are a few bright spots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects, where the majority of the reputed $100 million went, are kinetic and convincing -- I mean, as convincing as those kind of kinetic CGI effects can be. The CGI baby effects are not great, but I imagine those are very hard to do well... although for a hundred-million bucks, they could have been better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moose, the dog from &#34;Frasier,&#34; phoned in his usual exemplary performance. Steven Wright did well with a small part. Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings-as-villain, which we\&#39;ve seen before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but enjoyable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actress playing Mrs. Avery was cute-as-a-button, as you\&#39;d expect, and Jamie Kennedy stunk, as you\&#39;d expect. His best role so far was in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy), and in Three Kings. He should stick, perhaps, to more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he ain\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing and direction were, if anything, worse than Kennedy\&#39;s performance. I semi-remember one clever (though seven-year-old clever) line that I wish someone would quote accurately for the &#34;Memorable Quotes&#34; section. Something about Avery\&#39;s proposed costume being the &#34;crappiest crap in Craptown,&#34; it was a second-grade joke, but sort of funny in context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, since there\&#39;s nothing lower than a &#34;one,&#34; I give this film a &#34;one.&#34;&#39;
b&#34;Saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they got better movies than this, because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, down to more simple wishes, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development, or actual production values. Plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress, and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience. After the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively threw up it&#39;s hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film. I could be upset that I paid nine bucks to see it, and it was two hours I&#39;ll never get back, but on the other hand, it was an entertaining two hours I&#39;ll never get back. This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.&#34;
b&#34;Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, I found this film to be beyond awful. It was a huge disappointment since it was featured as one of the eight Horrorfest films. I can only hope the other seven were better. I was actually embarrassed for the friends I was able to convince to see this, and these are the same friends I made watch the remake of The Wicker Man. It has every clich\xc3\xa9 in the book. In fact, it went out of its way to include them. Let&#39;s start with the characters. Instead of one young damsel in distress, we get three: the single, hot mom with two daughters\xc2\x96 a blossoming yet brainless teenager and a cute yet simultaneously creepy little girl that you just know is going to have &#39;special&#39; skills including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The little girl is the same one that was in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She was a little annoying but not nearly as irritating Dakota Fanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these characters seemed like escapees from a LifeTime movie. I thought perhaps horror movies had moved on from scenes where the female characters go to bed in full makeup and run around in the dark announcing their presence to anyone with ears, but not this one. I also find it inconceivable that none of them could be bothered to secure the front door from arbitrarily opening day and night. To give you an idea about how uninvolved I was with these characters, I spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must have been on the set because everyone was in a coat even in their houses and how white their teeth were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all the formulaic plot machinations, the film does not build any suspense at all except to wonder when it will be over. There is more atmosphere at the local Giant in the middle of the most mundane of weekday afternoons. As for the dialogue, I could have sampled quotes from ten other films and cobbled together better, more believable discourse. The gore level, the eye candy for a horror fan, was minimal at best. Without their tiny weapons, the &#39;zombies&#39; were not menacing at all. You could probably drop kick a couple of them across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really kills it is its banality. Horror films, more than any other genre, cannot survive uninspired mediocrity. Give me a horror movie that is comically inept or outrageously over the top with gore. I can even take the new ones with their cringe inducing torture. Every once in a while I&#39;d appreciate a truly frightening one, anything but this.&#34;
b&#34;Me being from Australia and loving the series, I wasn&#39;t expecting much from the American version of Kath and Kim but I thought I&#39;d watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well,whats there to say. Its nothing special.Selma Blair is OK as Kim and actually had a few good lines, Molly Shannon is not a good Kath though. The good thing about Jane Turner&#39;s Kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents (such as when she says Yumor or Noice) it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks, but when Shannon has a go at the accent, its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the show really misses Sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about, because the Kal and Craig characters in this version are really not funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the Aussie version, although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name, not being compared to the Aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better. But if there is nothing else to do on a Sunday night (or Thursday night in America) then you cant do much harm in watching it, or better put on some of the Aussie version if you&#39;ve got it.&#34;
b&#39;The sequel that no one asked for to the movie no one wanted. There are obviously too many flaws with this movie to name here, so I\&#39;ll just concentrate on the acting. Miles O\&#39;Keefe would have been better suited to play the spritely Asian sidekick Thong, mainly because he would then have no dialogue. Lisa Foster delivers her lines displaying one emotion, dullness. Charles Borremel brings life to his part by pausing every five words. And finally the flamboyant, John Saxon-type guy......no comment is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &#34;Conan the Barbarian&#34; if you need to, but don\&#39;t waste your time with this low-budget loser.&#39;
b&#39;The first users comments are very detailed for a very vague movie. Not saying that I disagree, but this summary can be written in a few sentences. To get straight to the point, this is pretty much like watching the making of a really bad amateur porno flick. There are a few funny points in the movie, but with the kind of things that happen in todays youth everyday its actually kind of lame. The main actor in the movie is a pompous jackass and both guy and girl in the film are way too modest to be in a film like this. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least a somewhat attractive girl in the movie and towards the end you got to see almost full frontal nudity from the girl, thats it, thats the only thing thats worth watching it for. the end&#39;
b&#39;I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren\&#39;t stories, but the way he tried to show time passing by (the couple of joggers, who first appear jogging together, than jogging with a stroller (sic!), than the man alone...) and to link the &#34;adventures&#34; of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying &#34;Oh, a boat!&#34;) were awful. At the same time, I liked the way he portrayed the middle-high class, even in an excessive way. I think it is a lousy movie. If you want to watch it, do it as a film school student, trying to see technical aspects and issues. It will help a lot.&#39;
b&#39;The reviewer in Variety said this was &#34;overwritten and overlong&#34;, and I kind of agree with it. It has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when Cal (Crudup once again as the \&#39;lost, vacant, and kind of dull\&#39; male) and Julianne Moore find a map of the US in kind of an unbelievable place. The story is one of those 1970\&#39;s &#34;guy must find meaning in his life&#34; stories, and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his prime playing the role of Cal. The whole &#34;hitting the road to find meaning in life&#34; theme is still kind of interesting though. Does it all really lead back to family? I wasn\&#39;t so sure. The acting is okay, I particularly liked Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately only have supporting roles. I\&#39;d give it a \&#39;five\&#39;.&#39;
b&#34;First of all, let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject - quite the opposite. I am Polish and I have been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite a long time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the main problem lies with the script, which encompasses too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack overall meaning. In my opinion the cast doesn&#39;t really have a chance to show their ability. The exception is Andrzej Chyra, portraying Jerzy - the only interesting character. I wish the story was more focused on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, the film lacks emotion. Before seeing it I thought I would be moved, if only for sentimental reasons - but in fact I was watching it with an odd sense of detachment throughout, except for the final execution scene. It is done well and its placing is interesting and provides a climactic ending, although the idea of the Lord&#39;s Prayer being recited in unison by the executed officers seems a bit far-fetched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I suppose the film may have some educational value for those who are not familiar with the portrayed historical events, but in my opinion it fails as a work of cinema.&#34;
b&#34;Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, in his homeland at least, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both Shogun&#39;s Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity, and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they do come. This film has other flaws as well. The makeup, costumes and sound design are distractingly poor, and the battle scenes were substandard as well, inferior to other samurai films of earlier years (Seven Samurai comes to mind). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonny Chiba plays the Sonny Chiba character in Shogun&#39;s Samurai, the no-nonsense master swordsman who strides through the film, scowling menacingly. What a guy; he even gets to wear an eye patch. If you were expecting to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you may be disappointed; his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo, and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting, he disappears for good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the strengths of the film are its story, which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films, and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil. Two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father, who may have had some help on his way out. Early on, it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn&#39;t be more clearly good and evil; after all, the older brother stammers and has a birthmark, the sure sign of a villain. Eventually, however, it becomes clear that in a winner-takes-all struggle for power, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;m glad that I did not expect too much when I saw this sequel to one of my favourite childhood films. The storyline was dull and unconvincing as were the characters, and I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. I also did not think that the characters themselves were similar from the previous film. Charlie had changed, and now, he has a girlfriend. The first film had some good music, but the music in this film was unmemorable. In short, this film just did not do it for me. And, looking at other user feedback, it looks like it didn&#39;t do it for a lot of you. It&#39;s not worth watching.&#34;
b&#39;One of my favorite &#34;bum&#34; actors, C. Tom Howell, stars in this tepid remake of WOTW. He runs around a lot, while a CGI-generated spider-like machine goes around killing everyone. The budget for this one obviously was pretty low. It also was one of The Asylum productions. Have you seen any of those? Yikes! I am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big-budget Spielberg version was slaying them at the box office. And if truth be told, neither version is all that hot. The George Pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of the H.G. Wells novel, primitive special effects and all. Perhaps because Gene Barry was much more convincing in the lead than Howell or Tom Cruise.&#39;
b&#34;This was one of the worst movies that I have ever watched. The story was about a woman prisoner sent into space to try and save mankind but what it actually turned out to be was that the prisoner was actually put on board a space ship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander. All the story was about was having sex over and over again. There was no need for all of this footage - only to create a soft porn film. Of course we had to see the heroin of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes. I don&#39;t know what all this had to do with the actual plot of the movie -except I assume to get men to watch it. I gave it 1 out of 10 only because there was no other rating lower. Don&#39;t waste your money or time- it has nothing to do with science fiction but rather a movie for young adolescent boys to watch to see t&amp;a. The creature was shown only more than half way through the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with Signorney Weaver. Poor excuse for entertainment.&#34;
b&#34;Sad to say this is one of the sillier of John Wayne&#39;s series of poverty row westerns for Lone Star Productions. Here he is a United States Marshal on the trail of a bandit known only, I kid you not, as the Shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No it&#39;s not Lamont Cranston, it&#39;s some dude who gives his orders through an open wall safe so his men don&#39;t see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable, you&#39;ll know within 10 minutes of the film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And another reviewer here is quite wrong, no squeals or groans from the audience would have occurred because Gabby Hayes was still playing a variety of roles and he&#39;s clean shaven here. He had not yet found his niche as the lovable oldtimer sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes like the Duke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on he does lead his men quite openly in the climax so I&#39;m not sure what the point of the original gimmick with the wall safe was. I don&#39;t think those that wrote this one knew either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wayne gets Yakima Canutt as an Indian sidekick here and the relationship is just about the same as an unmasked Lone Ranger and Tonto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s all pretty silly if you ask me.&#34;
b&#34;Probably one of the worst movies ever made, I&#39;m still trying to figure if it was meant to be fun, but for sure I had no fun at all. Maybe the movie lost something during the english-italian translation, dunno, for sure I miss the guts to watch it again in original version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rate for it 2/10, and I feel like I&#39;m being pretty generous (let&#39;s say 1 point is for Liv cause she&#39;s a nice babe, and the other point is for those decent actors that got trapped into a worthless, useless and pathetic movie)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex&#34;
b&#39;****Contains Spoilers****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I watched for this show to finally come on so that I could see it. I taped it so I could watch it several times, and there is something about this show that really bothers me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that this was a made-for-TV movie. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, which is a channel that I despise. Because it was made for TV, I can ignore the huge plot holes. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in Ally Sheedy\&#39;s character. I can overlook the fact that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both of whom are very talented actors, were definately not reaching the best of their abilities. I can look past the fact that Don Diamont\&#39;s character was so cliche\&#39;d, that you knew when you saw him he was the villain. I can even pass over the obvious mistake in the timeline (She\&#39;s raped during her winter break, and then over a year later she has the baby from it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major thing that I can\&#39;t get over is this: There are two trials for the custody of the child. In the first trial, custody is awarded to the child\&#39;s father because he is &#34;better educated, has a degree from a community college, and has a full time job.&#34; In the second trial the judgement is reversed because the Judge feels that there is lack of evidence that Emma (RLC\&#39;s character)is an unfit mother, and custody shouldn\&#39;t be taken from the primary caretaker and given to someone with no previous interaction with the child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is this: Nowhere during the course of these trials is the fact that a thirtysomthing year old man raped a 15 year old girl and got her pregnant taken into consideration! Whether it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Wouldn\&#39;t that be taken into consideration when the judge is choosing him for custody because he\&#39;s a &#34;mature adult?&#34; Mature adults don\&#39;t have sex with minors! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not the worst cable movie that you would ever see, but it\&#39;s not a great show either. ** out of ****&#39;
b&#34;Let me first start with the obvious: antisemitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of Jews. That said, the problem with this movie is that it views the United States - probably the most welcoming society ever to Jews outside of Israel - as a not very different place from Nazi Germany. Set in 1943, the movie is about a man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses!. A number of very nasty things happen to him after that (he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one, his neighbors shunned him, all ending up in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller&#39;s self pitying, patronizing novels, the sort that gave liberalism a bad name.&#34;
b&#34;No movie I&#39;ve ever seen before has even come close to being as boring and stupid as this hunk of junk. And I have always been a big B-movie fan. After viewing this total piece of crap, though I can honestly say that this doesn&#39;t even come close to being a B-movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one in this movie could act if their life depended on it. The script is so stupid I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard anyone talk like this in my life. The writer should go spend a few years studying real-life people to see just how they act and talk, even then they would not be able to make a watchable movie because it is so obvious that no one involved in this movie has any talent driving them at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monster toys. Also, forget about any sexy scenes, the women in the leather outfits are so grotesque, you would sooner puke than get turned on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this pointless drivel unless you want to be bored out of your mind!&#34;
b&#34;OK, I don&#39;t want to upset anyone who enjoyed this film but it was a really bad movie. Just the way the scenes were edited and the acting, it made me cringe at some points. I really tried to enjoy it but it was like a student film, they must have had the smallest budget. I really liked the story line to an extent and the characters were likable but the film on a whole was just awful. Also, why is it that in almost every film with lesbian characters one of them has to either commit suicide or die or turn straight?!?! This is so sending a wrong and unrealistic message. I gave it 3 stars and everything considered I think that was very kind of me. Only watch this film if you want to laugh at how bad it is.&#34;
b&#39;Shwaas may have a good story, but the director is utterly devoid of talent. He does not know when to stop. When the story calls for people to act confused, there are ten minute scenes of people miming the act of confusion. When the story calls for a little background history, there are ten minute scenes of Konkan\&#39;s greenery. When the story calls for a kid throwing tantrums... you get the idea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the extreme closeups so that you can count people\&#39;s nose hair. There are movies that should be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a 13&#34; TV. Also Amruta Subhash who plays Asavari is the worst actress I\&#39;ve seen in quite a long time. A normal human being would need to practise overacting for years to achieve what she does so effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4/10 solely because the subject matter is different, and the story is not bad. The fact that a movie like Shwaas gets to be India\&#39;s entry to the Oscars tells volumes not about the state of Indian cinema but the state of Indian judging committees. A movie is not good just because its subject matter is arty.&#39;
b&#39;This movie is a great movie ONLY if you need something to sit and laugh at the stupidity of it. As a geologist this movie gets most of the important facts wrong and uses actors that are too young to even be considered in the top of their fields. It is interesting how it shows spurting lava in massive caverns below the Earth\&#39;s surface. It also is funny how seismically active areas are shown to have massive destruction from a 6.5 magnitude earthquake. They seem to forget the building standards in these areas would be higher needing a bigger quake to do this much damage. Also it is funny how much they make the coast line of Washington State and also Oregon to look as though they are nice beaches of Southern California. The Jelly donut analogy is very entertaining even if the way it is used is wrong. The director does a good job of adding more comic relief with the 2 &#34;supossed&#34; PhD\&#39;s.&#39;
b&#34;Jean-Hugh Anglade is excellent as the teenaged boy who wants to be a whore to please the man he loves, but the rest of this film is so bad--acting, writing, cinematography, and everything else--that Anglade&#39;s performance is wasted. Sad to see so fine an actor in such a garbage flick.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Cleo\&#39;s Second Husband&#34; is an amateurish attempt at psychodrama with more to fault than to praise. The plot is hacked, the story monotonous, the acting poor, the execution second rate, etc. Not worth the time unless maybe your a relative of one of the actors. PU! (D)&#39;
b&#39;This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook &#34;How to write a space disaster movie&#34; and followed it play by play. In particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. But, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. To learn that the film was nominated for a &#34;Special Visual Effects&#34; Emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more believable effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the plot holes are too numerous to mention. But I will pick one out as an example. Now, I\&#39;m no NASA expert, but surely it\&#39;s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.&#39;
b&#34;this is complete crap do not watch the main character is so f u c king concerned that the doc&#39;s bomb shelter is not big enough for everyone thus he claims the doc is playing god by saying who lives and who dies all during his 13itching, he kills people without thinking twice and beats people to near death also, the main character is an selfish little a$$ wipe as because of him, the doc who made the shelter died and his friend died. he also killed several no name cops the main character is just a f u c king dumb hillbilly s h i t head that&#39;s got no concept of the greater good also, this movie makes no f u c king sense. tell me why a comet would cause seismic activity? (if you say gravity, i will f u c king rape you cause the comet is smaller then the moon and you don&#39;t see the moon causing volcano eruptions and earthquakes and avalanches).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why does a comet cause atmospheric discharges (the red lightning, also why is it red?) in addition, if you don&#39;t know, the F U C KING MOONS BEEN HIT BY COMETS THOUSANDS OF TIMES!!! thats why there&#39;s f u c king craters everywhere on the moon. the size of an object needed to shatter the moon into the fragments as portrayed in the movie would require a comet around the size of the moon itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it takes huge amounts of KE to cause an satellite to explode like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a goof in this movie is that the nuclear explosion in space resulted in a disk shaped shock wave. this is incorrect as in space, the explosion should have produced an spherical shock wave. this inaccuracy is also apparent when the comet hits the moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, someone tell me why the commander (the person who drives the big old broken plane) suddenly felt the need to die? i mean he&#39;s just like walking with them to the shelter, then he stops, he salutes the main character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTF?!?!!?!? the main character is also an ugly @$$hole, he&#39;s got a huge forehead and thinning hair. disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!&#34;
b&#34;Supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the UFO nonsense. It&#39;s all a crock, some kind of money making racket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one I&#39;ve heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology. The paranormal? It&#39;s real, just demonic, unless it takes place in a Christian context, then of course, it is of God. Simple, if it isn&#39;t of God, it&#39;s the of the Devil, stupid! So I suppose since Beethoven&#39;s 9th symphony wasn&#39;t inspired by God, it must have been written under demonic influence. Or so would the logic lead ad absurdum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are informed that since the Bible does not tell of life on other planets in the Universe, therefore there is none (a version of the Ad Ignorantium fallacy) and that God created the Universe so huge, so grand to show us his almighty power. I think of Carl Sagan&#39;s remark that if God created such a huge Universe and stuck life only on Earth it&#39;d have been a tremendous waste of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are UFOs? They are Demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking Christian event, the rupture...I mean Rapture. Before the tribulation, the true Christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic, confusion, car and plane crashes...whatever. Therefore Satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event. All part of Satan&#39;s plan which will of course keep people from looking to God or Jesus and fall for the lies of the AntiChrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another, in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange, and the mysterious in as much as possible, first by the known, if not solely by the known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for. I think I&#39;d look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away, gotten lost, or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens, or the supernatural or Satan or some such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often lured to Free Rock Concerts, that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt Christian music, followed by a sermon and an altar call. This kind of blatant deception one might think would be more Satan&#39;s ballgame. But maybe because the Christian faith is soon to be in its death throes, these guys feel that anything goes, any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like Islam, the world&#39;s fastest growing religion which may well replace Christianity, as Islam is far more cohesive and unified, and logically more tenable than Christian fundamentalism. Although this should offer little advantage to mankind, as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of Pascal&#39;s wager. The atheistic Aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told. Well, if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, no worry...but what if you&#39;re wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or Christian fantasy, is a false dilemma or Black and White fallacy. Even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make Christianity correct by default, nor if Christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology, that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all we know, Native American spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the Earth and its creatures a wee bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie should be stamped right on the box: Caution: Contains religious Propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;The Danish Bladerunner&#34; is boldly stated on the box. Are you kidding me?! This film is a complete drag. When I\&#39;m thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen, I usually pause the vcr, so I won\&#39;t miss anything. Not this time. I actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge, just so I wouldn\&#39;t have to go back. Why the hell is there not ONE sciencefiction-scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work? It\&#39;s mindboggling. One of the premises of film, is that our hero (who\&#39;s a hacker), has a little computerassistant to help him (the Microsoft Office paperclip finally caught on in the future). When he loses the assistant in the movie, he\&#39;s helpless and can\&#39;t get into any computers. HE\&#39;S A HACKER! It\&#39;s like saying, that you can\&#39;t drive your car, if you don\&#39;t have your lucky &#34;driving-cap&#34; on. I won\&#39;t even go into the lightning-effect when he recieves electroshock...&#39;
b&#39;First i will say that i am going to be as subjective as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly ever review movies, but this one in particular i felt i had to review. This movie Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children, based off the ultra popular rpg (Final Fantasy VII) for the ps1 has been in the works for quite some time. After the years of hype and the dozens of trailers (none of which i ever saw, i had only seen stills) this movie got the legions of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan, and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself. So i had thought to myself, &#34;WHAT COULD GO WRONG?&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the movie started out OK in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed. Without a doubt, this is the best looking CGI animation around, but that won\&#39;t help a weak plot, undeveloped characters,and over indulgent action scenes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the story basically. These three silver haired nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game, are supposedly clones of Sephiroth (he\&#39;s the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed clones)are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well, probably to make an army (of kids?) They also center some of the story on some kid named Denzel, i don\&#39;t know who this kid is, or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time. So the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma, that only affects the children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now Cloud must save the day from these guys. Apparently Cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight, i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time. Maybe if the movie wasn\&#39;t so over the top, then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible. The real problem of this movie is logic. Now i know what you are gonna say, &#34;But it\&#39;s called Final FANTASY! it should have those ideas in it!&#34; well that is a foolish way to think, the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that CONTEXT. Context and logic in this movie is inconsistent, i could explain it all, but if i did, i would end up writing the screenplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite. like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans. They show up, do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is too long here is the simpler review-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pros- the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cons- illogical over indulgent action/ unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) weak plot super human characters=no suspense the j-rock soundtrack/score (what happened to the orchestra?) Horrible ending&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG TIME SPOILER-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the ending of this movie really disappointed me. they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back, the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest. then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not that the movie doesn\&#39;t have it\&#39;s moments. its is worth seeing for its visuals. but thats all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that it\&#39;s not really a good movie. it is strictly for blinded fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and story telling.&#39;
b&#39;The creature? Yeah, it and the movie it stars in. Hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch this for all eternity. Six college students shack up in a condemned hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster who must claim five victims before it returns to &#34;the shadowy world from which it came!&#34; Other than having major logic and coherence problems (plus the fact it appears to be unfinished), this disaster is terribly acted, written, edited (by J.R. Bookwalter) and directed, and the make-up FX are almost nonexistent. It\&#39;s also significantly shorter than it claims (at only 80 minutes), but I\&#39;m not complaining. It\&#39;s the worst movie I\&#39;ve seen from executive producer Charles Band\&#39;s Full Moon productions and boy is that BAD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To note, I almost didn\&#39;t bother with a review, but this has gotten inexplicably good reviews on here and I figured a varying opinion was in order. Proceed with caution!&#39;
b&#34;Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. The scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors, each with a different goal. Some are Capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. There&#39;s even an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. It&#39;s hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone, and the storyline not exactly believable. Only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors--some smaller parts, such as Judge Doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also very well played.&#34;
b&#34;I was really looking forward to this movie but sadly it didn&#39;t live up to expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good movie has the audience identifying/empathising/sympathising with the main actor. Unfortunately this was very hard to do with Samantha Morton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline seemed very disjointed and didn&#39;t flow as it should/could have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keifer Sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part. Beautiful scenery and the acting of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis was about the only plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe by being a kiwi I set the bar higher for locally made films. Maybe the change of director/ supposedly hard to work with main actor has biased my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#39;m just trying to make excuses for a movie which could have been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of maybes which still does not explain why this movie just lacked anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could have been great, it wasn&#39;t.&#34;
b&#39;I couldn\&#39;t help but laugh when I saw what the public could be made to think was email back in 1996. Apparently email is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with lame voice synthesis reading every comment out loud. And some of the other &#34;tech&#34; aspects are also laugh-out-loud funny. I\&#39;d swear the &#34;high tech&#34; communications centre she has actually has a few Commodore 64 monitors in it. Almost like watching the movie Hackers nowadays, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that for most of the movie the lead actress carries off the illusion of being disabled, the final part of the movie has an unexplained use of her legs which somehow I can\&#39;t ignore. I mean, why include something so stupid? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to sum up: the plot is pretty predictable, the acting bad, the killer quite guessable. But it can be amusing in a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 kind of way I guess.&#39;
b&#39;Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and producers think we all are idiots. If not how should we understand this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American pilots take off on Mig-29s. Suddenly all aircrafts turn to F-16s. Ha, a magic! After an action... Migs land. The magic again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I mention that F-16s had Israel markings? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another magic: obviously unarmed L-39 trainers are bombing enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And more magic: while all movie is situated in Europe, we can see a desert in almost any flying scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above, because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots bombarded with molotovs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, OK, this is a movie. I should write about its story... wait. A story? Yes there is SOME story in this film. And its horrible as well.&#39;
b&#39;I went to see this film last night at the National Film Theatre in London, as a birthday treat. It was the the first time I\&#39;ve seen it, and I think it has now overtaken the dreadful &#34;Twister&#34; as the worst film I have ever seen. Disjointed for no reason, self indulgent and full of imagery that oscillates from the crass and obvious to the obscure and unintelligible, not particularly beautifully or grimily shot, I really don\&#39;t understand why this is considered classic, gay or otherwise. I normally enjoy films that push boundaries or even films that are hard to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography. But this was truly, truly awful.&#39;
b&#34;I feel conflicted about this film - it is one of the most beautiful films I&#39;ve seen, and provides insightful looks into a lost culture. There was an early scene of men in caps and moustaches sitting around a table, with a woman serving, and an accordion playing, that brought tears to my eyes, just because of the way it captured a way of life that must be incomprehensible to many today. It presents the lives of the characters as being inextricably bound up with the life of the village, another lost concept in today&#39;s world. Symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little dated. The fatal flaws of the movie to me were the lack of any compelling dramatic drive, and a total lack of humor. I never felt like I knew any of the characters beyond very basic universal things like grieving over the loss of a loved one, etc. The people were stick figures in the director&#39;s tableaux involving natural disasters, war, etc. The film was just one beautiful tragic scene after another, with no involving narrative thread and no humanity. As a result, it seemed very abstract, irrelevant to the lives of real people. In the end, I was too bored to finish watching it.&#34;
b&#34;First, let me make it clear that I&#39;m a big fan of bad sci-fi, especially when it involves gigantic, city-stomping monsters. But this one is so fantastically lame that I can&#39;t even like it for being bad. They apparently didn&#39;t shave enough money off the budget by skimping on the props (the only prop we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an oversized novelty pencil, available at Spencer&#39;s Gifts for about fifteen bucks), they also decided not to outlay for concept or plot. The monster DOES look okay, in my opinion, but it doesn&#39;t have enough interaction with the backgrounds, i.e. not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre. The general rule of giant monster movies is: If you don&#39;t have a lot of fake-looking buildings to smash, then you&#39;d better have another fake-looking monster to wrestle with. This movie has neither. I can&#39;t make my final complaint about the movie without giving away the ending, but suffice to say the origin of the monster, and the method found to get rid of it, just don&#39;t hold water. Not even as well as most of these movies. Skip it.&#34;
b&#34;To start off, I love Steven Seagal, the man is a genius. But recent movies leave me to wonder, Is he trying anymore? His latest movies show almost no effort on Seagal&#39;s part. In Out of Reach, its too obvious that his lines are dubbed over. . What Seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to his fans, but even more to Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the 2nd scene or so, when he prepares to zip-line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money, it shows him set-up the gun and hook it on a neon sign. Your might be saying to yourself, &#39;Yah, so what does this have to do with Van Damme?&#39;. Well that scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called the Order. Rent both, watch both, compare both and you will lose respect for Seagal. Not only was Today You Die garbage, but it was, dare I say, an insult. Seagal&#39;s Aikido moves are still good, but why isn&#39;t he doing great movies like Marked for Death or Above the law, hes still got the moves and the attitude, I&#39;m just left wondering &#39;Why Seagal, Why?&#39;. There are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline, and such idiotic story lines on top of that. I hope the up-coming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because these last chain of movies he made, especially Today You Die, really made me wonder if he has the stuff to make more great action movies like Double Team. Please, don&#39;t watch this movie unless you hate Seagal, if you love his movies don&#39;t watch this, it WILL make you question his future in the action film genre.&#34;
b&#34;Stu Ungar is considered by many to be the greatest poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary self-destructive force of nature - tiny in stature, but a huge heart for the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we have here is a kind of Hallmark film about the dangers of gambling. Sure, he wins, he loses, he blows it all on sex, drugs, and more gambling we get it, but where is the real play - where is what made him the greatest card player of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much too flat, and frankly boring in places, this gets a four because we get to learn something about Stu the man, but Stu the card player, nada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely shot and presented up to a point this is the perfect example of how not to make a film about cards: honestly, ESPN&#39;s coverage of the World Series is more watchable than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waste of a great chance.&#34;
b&#39;This movie is bad, so bad that my mother who can barely stand the &#34;suspense&#34; of Disney\&#39;s Snow White, was chuckling through out the entire movie. My first warning should\&#39;ve been that it was in the $5.50 bin at Wal-mart. But I have actually found some good movies in that bin, so i can\&#39;t fault if for this debacle. The second warning should have been that when the cashier rang up the DVD, it was actually $3.88. Again I have never been one to ignore the cheapies. THis movie is definitely not for people looking for something good to watch, and it most certainly isn\&#39;t for everyone that enjoys the occasional bad movie. If you need background noise while you are doing something like playing cards with some friends, then get this but if you are looking for something to actually watch don\&#39;t even bother. It was really disappointing because there were a lot of good actors. I felt like i was watching a chocolate version of Willard.&#39;
b&#39;This game was terrible. I think they worked too hard on the visuals and didn\&#39;t do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I mean, the visuals look incredible, but is the game really &#34;fun&#34;? NO! I mean it\&#39;s like &#34;hey let\&#39;s jump off buildings&#34; and all I\&#39;m doing is holding up and A/X. The game play just isn\&#39;t there, and I don\&#39;t agree with what Ubisoft did, because they had this hot girl (the producer of the game, Jade Raymond), and they were like &#34;OK we\&#39;ve got this hot girl, let\&#39;s pimp her&#34; and if you go to gaming websites, you\&#39;re not gonna see gameplay stuff of Assassin\&#39;s Creed, you\&#39;ll see her face with a microphone and it\&#39;ll be like &#34;We interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies!&#34; It\&#39;s like man, shut the F*@K UP WHO CARES?! Apparently...a lot of people do, because they bought the game and like it...I mean compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that really doesn\&#39;t abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and delivers in the most important part, GAMEPLAY! They were able to do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still stunning, the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing, and THAT\&#39;S a game that deserves game of the year. NOT Assassin\&#39;s Creed, man, it doesn\&#39;t even deserve to even be a NOMINEE for Game of the Year. The hype around this game where it was like &#34;oh it\&#39;s the next generation of gaming&#34;....really? I think not! So let me get this straight here, because I think the people liking this game are only liking it because they\&#39;re Jade fans, so I\&#39;ll tell you guys, JADE WILL NOT MAKE OUT WITH YOU OR ANYTHING IF YOU LOVE OR DEFEND THIS GAME! If you want a REAL game on the PS3, get Uncharted: Drake\&#39;s Fortune, if you want a REAL game for the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a ton of other games too), and if you want a REAL game just in all the systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, pressing two buttons for doing all this cool stuff, is that REALLY a fun game? The only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after it\&#39;ll end up being more innovative and fun. And this game just isn\&#39;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.3/10 A LIVING HELL!&#39;
b&#39;I sat (uncomfortably) through this film becoming more and more staggered at just how it got made at all. The script itself makes the acting look embarrassing, and it fundamentally becomes a waste of time for everybody concerned. If you avoid seeing one film this year, make it this one.&#39;
b&#34;Creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tight-rope. It either works, or it does not. Grandma&#39;s Boy is one of those movies that does not work. It may have a few very funny parts, but for the majority, it&#39;s just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in Adam Sandler films (sans Sandler himself, he&#39;s just a producer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. He&#39;s 35, and is the best tester and game player at his otherwise kid-filled workplace. He ends up getting his apartment and his stuff taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just been spending the rent money on Philipino hookers and not paying the landlord). Desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond) and her two roommates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s the basic plot of the film, thrown in with subplots about a hot new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as Velma in Scooby Doo) trying to get the testers to complete a new game as fast as they can, a robot-like game creating prodigy J.P. (Joel Moore) who works with Alex and wears much of the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix, and of course, all sorts of sex and drug related jokes. That&#39;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it just is not funny. It is totally mind-numbingly boring, and only sparingly funny. Nothing really happens at all. No emotion, no real sense of direction, and a whole ton of intense swearing. You find yourself maybe laughing at a few funny quips that the actors say, but otherwise sit in complete boredom, wishing you had not even bothered with the film. How this film was greenlit and how Fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s just no entertainment value to come from it. None of the actors are actually putting in good performances, they are just acting like idiots for the camera, and hoping for the best. Stoner comedy has been done before multiple times, and on occasion, actually works (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle and Dazed and Confused come to mind). Here, it just makes for making the film even less funny than it is already. The random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts really does not make the film any better either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than a few funny one-liners, this movie should just be out-right missed altogether. It&#39;s not very funny, the entire plot is silly, it&#39;s boring, and it just makes for one horrendous film. Avoid it like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.5/10.&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;ve never seen the original movie others have commented on, so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the message of the movie to be,: if you only worry about yourself, all will be right with the world, everything will fall into place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect and like you more, your employers will want you more, pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this message to be reprehensible and totally false.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos for the very funny birthing scene at the end; there isn&#39;t a mother out there who won&#39;t laugh during that scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very disappointing movie plot. I didn&#39;t find myself rooting for anyone in this movie. I thought they were all pathetic self absorbed individuals that I just didn&#39;t care what happened to them and that&#39;s not a movie people want to see.&#34;
b&#34;There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting, plot, effects, continuity, etc. - and that word is poor. The government wants to asses the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a mutant something-or-other (looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face) wreaks havoc around the accident scene, which includes a favorite place for the window-fogging, partying set. Therefore, some young people - as well as a law enforcement officer - are among the creature&#39;s victims. You gotta be extremely unparticular about how you spend your time - or rich, if you spend any money - to view this epic.&#34;
b&#39;The only reason I watched this movie a second time, was to learn the name of the &#34;second banana&#34; girl playing opposite Katie Holms. Her name is Marisa Coughlan. Never heard of her before. She is lovely. Captivating. With an animated face, and cute bod, she is highly watchable... She\&#39;s got real, &#34;Poisenality&#34;... More than a passing vibe of Grace Kelly... with youthful exuberance. I think she is Irish in gene pool, (my favorite female DNA) so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful Irish American. The movie is unremarkable, Katie Holms is classic beauty in the flesh. But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. In 1999 when this movie was made, she was around 25 years old, in her prime. This reminds me of another silly, worthless movie with the only redemption being the Pretty Girl in it. It was &#34;Career Opportunites&#34; with the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly. Or &#34;Grease II&#34; the first time I saw Michelle Pfeiffer.&#39;
b&#34;This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment I&#39;ve ever experienced with a film. The acting is horrific, the suspense build up minimal, and the plot overall is ridiculous. I found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim, because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we&#39;re asked to make in logic, and the so-called suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried. I&#39;m dismayed that a sequel is planned, because it means they&#39;ll be asking us to once again swallow a sub par plot line. If this is an example of Raw Feed&#39;s work, I think I&#39;ll be avoiding any and all future films by them.&#34;
b&#39;This is a hard film to rate. While it truly deserves its 3 (or perhaps even a two), for an Al Adamson film, it\&#39;s exceptional--and practically Adamson\&#39;s very best. That\&#39;s because unlike many Adamson films, there are times when NURSE SHERRI almost looks competent. But, being an Adamson film, you know that sooner or later that crappiness MUST rear its ugly head! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins with some bizarre cult leader of a huge congregation (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like he\&#39;s made of blue cheese. However, in the process, the cult dude has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital. He apparently dies, but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see the film, he appears to have possibly recovered--only to hear later that he\&#39;d died. Because the guy is the b.f.f. of Satan, however, his evil soul can\&#39;t die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess Nurse Sherri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady--demonic possession or not. At times she acts like a zombie and at others she\&#39;s violently homicidal. So I ask...&#34;why didn\&#39;t her boyfriend (a doctor) think this was, perhaps, problematic?!&#34;. In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the booby hatch!!! Oh, and speaking of boobies...this movie is NOT the breast-filled sex romp its title and posters would indicate. While there are a few bare breasts here and there, they are irrelevant to the plot and only seen very briefly (1/2 second or so) in all but one scene. So, if you are a perv, this movie is not for you--though a few places in the film (such as the nurse undressing for a patient) make it look like the film MIGHT have, at one time, been designed as a porn flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a bad movie fan, however, there is enough to whet your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that aren\&#39;t zombie-like--and I am not even talking about Sherri. Especially noticeable is one of the very final scenes--I have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my life--and this includes Ed Wood\&#39;s films! There are also a few more cheap touches, such as the bad animation of the &#34;green stuff&#34;, the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood (I\&#39;d get a cop...better yet, an army of cops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So despite these problems, why do I think it\&#39;s good for an Adamson film? Well, the story isn\&#39;t all bad and he was able to build tension very well. Many false alarms early on made my heart race a bit. Also, the car crash, while irrelevant, came off pretty well and was practically big-budget for Adamson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a good film and one most people would be bored watching. However, fans of Adamson or inept films will like it--it does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Paranormal State&#34; is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. I enjoy watching what the &#34;team&#34; has to say and what they &#34;find&#34;, however, I know that the entire show along with it\&#39;s build ups and story lines are completely set up. They go to real haunted locations and I suspect that they speak with actual witnesses. I commonly feel as I watch it that I am not watching non-fiction but an actual movie that is contradictory to reality. I personally would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scare seeker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting show. Stick to &#34;Ghost Hunters&#34;&#39;
b&#34;I was waiting for this movie for a time. In the first day of the air in Turkey, I watched it. It was totally a disappointment for me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but the one in the screen was a fictional one. First of all, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great conquer was portrayed like a soft, calm, even a loser one. You can not feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created was conquered \xc2\xbe (even more) of the world know in those years. To do that, Cengiz first unite the Asian tribes. However, in the movie, this loser man is in one scene poor-alone man, and in second scene, he is commanding armies. War scenes were incredibly week. In the final battle, the Mongol horseman were using double swords on their sides and cutting the enemy. : ) As a consequences, me and my friends just laugh at that scenes. Mongol army means Mongol archery horseman. You can not see that in the movie. Another ill thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. I do not want to go into the scenes which was portrayed Cengiz as a prophet. We can say in the integrity of the movie, it is acceptable. However, the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of Cengiz Khan after Cengiz gave him a mission is really funny. When the monk died in the desert, Cengiz&#39;s wife feel this dead and she find the corpse in the continent. We are talking about the Asia\xc2\x85 Again we laughed. There are a lot of more things to say but, I don&#39;t feel that this movie has value to talk more.&#34;
b&#34;Margaret Mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess! Fine costuming and sets can&#39;t even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by Joanne Whalley (as the title character) and the ever-bland Timothy Dalton (as Rhett). Even worse than the acting--and perhaps partially explaining it--is the script, which is astoundingly cliched and predictable. Add to that hellishly bad script a score that&#39;ll have you cringing, and you&#39;ve got a disaster I wouldn&#39;t wish on any viewer. SCARLETT is just amazingly lousy, and I can&#39;t imagine how it ever got made, much less made it to video.&#34;
b&#39;I saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996. I remember I was already familiar with Elijah Wood\&#39;s work (that\&#39;s right, he made stuff before &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;!) and the merchandising tie-ins to the film were pretty abundant (&#34;Flipper&#34; water guns were even circulating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adults were reminded of the old movies and TV show and for nostalgia\&#39;s sake took their kids to see it, who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it wasn\&#39;t what anyone expected and flopped severely. You know a movie\&#39;s in trouble when a boy swims away from a Hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away, and the kid -- instead of getting out of the water into a boat -- floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he hasn\&#39;t taken into mind that the shark is still out there, perhaps even below him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is Paul Hogan. He looks old, crusty and tired of recycling his Croc Dundee shtick. By now, no one even remembered &#34;Crocodile Dundee&#34; much less Hogan, and I half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn\&#39;t know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fish-out-of-water/social-satire laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a really poor &#34;family&#34; movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times. I hated it when I saw it in theaters back in \&#39;96 and I hate it more now.&#39;
b&#34;This movie was not that good at all. Here is the first clue and that it is not gonna be a strong movie, Harrison Ford&#39;s name not only appears first but it is also bigger than the title. The music was nominated for an Oscar, What the heck was that? That music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. The acting was sub par at best, except the Amish boy he did a decent job for being so young. Then you have the story which was weak and a little over the place, and it won for adapted! The music was horrid, I know I already said something but it was really bad. The premises was real good and it should be remade. Well that&#39;s all I really have on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Average Movie Guy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Trever&#34;
b&#34;If pulp fiction and Get shorty didn&#39;t exist this might be an OK film.When i say this i mean that nothing from this film is it&#39;s own unless it&#39;s another bit of terrible dialogue or a clich\xc3\xa9 full scene.All the lines like &#39;i won&#39;t say more than i have to if that&#39; from Get shorty seem to appear in this rubbish sequel, all the cameos like Steven Tyler&#39;s are acted terribly and are not needed and as for Christina Milian, man, don&#39;t get me started.Sadly some of the coolest actors and actresses like John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem like they are trying to be down with the kids and hip and have nearly ruined there reputation because of this film and frankly i think the best acting is from The rock who plays alongside one of my least favourite actors, Vince Vaughn.The man tries to be funny throughout with him taking the mickey of how apparently rappers talk.Cedric the entertainer and Andre 3000 play another terrible double act {i personally think the background actors were better than Cedric and Andre} and the only funny part of the acting of Cedric,Andre and the rest of there gang do is the way there trousers are down to there knees so you can clearly see there boxers and the only reason i find this funny is because lots of people actually do that.So in conclusion this film tries to be funny and fails miserably, it doesn&#39;t have any new material, comedy or coolness throughout as it copies every other film and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is to it&#39;s brilliant predecessor Get shorty.Oh yes i forgot to mention there is a BIG clich\xc3\xa9 at the end.&#34;
b&#34;Having seen just about every movie on record that a child of the eighties could have seen, this ranks at the very, very, very bottom of the heap of bad movies I have ever seen. It&#39;s depressing and just plain, painful to watch. Nuff said.&#34;
b&#34;From an artistic standpoint, the movie fails to entertain or provide any moral resolution. The plot is hard to follow, if there is one at all. The acting is tough to stomach. The dialogue is cliche and clearly written by somebody who doesn&#39;t know English. Only the cinematography was worth watching in this movie, although you can still see flaws in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Asian-American female, the movie angered me because it proved how narrow minded people can be. Politically speaking, putting Asian women in such disgraceful roles should be outlawed. Perpetuating stereotypes of Asian prostitutes is not only bad for the self-esteem of Asian women, but also to the country as a whole. I feel for the lead actress who played Maya and the exploitation she must have faced in playing such a role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Americans, please avoid this movie. Art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for one another, not hold it back.&#34;
b&#34;This movie is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is REALLY bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is might as well be half a minute long and shown 200 times in a row, because you&#39;d get the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The phone rings. Man A answers the phone and gets annoyed by Man B. Man A curses off Man B, and then hangs up the phone. Repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the entire movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. TRUST ME.&#34;
b&#34;Wicked Little Things has an excellent synopsis: empty house beside abandoned mine in woods with tragic past; family moves into house and strange things begin to happen; little creepy children begin to pop up here and there doing creepy-little-children-things. But that is where the cleverness and potential fun ends. This group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier, and now appear roving the woods (poor make-up) with weapons looking for flesh to eat. Oh I get it, this is a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm....while I can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, this just didn&#39;t work. What was the children&#39;s motivation in seeking to devour flesh? Why did they need weapons? Did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage giggling because they felt this was going to be a cool/scary movie? I found that after thirty minutes I felt the familiar resignation that I had just wasted my time on another modern crap-fest. While the acting was good, and the setting/cinematography of good quality as well, the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether. A bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised rodents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is not scary, and while I can appreciate the story, perhaps have even enjoyed it if I had read it instead of watched it, I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is more accurately called Wicked Little Turd.&#34;
b&#34;I have little to no interest in seeing another awful movie, that totally lacks anything new creative or funny, abusing the National Lampoon tag. How ever something caught my eye in the cast of this movie. I see Danielle Fishel&#39;s name i&#39;m a big fan of boy meets world! But the movies shes in are awful. More so as a fan i&#39;m not rewarded by seeing her terrible movies with the treasure of bare breast. So this is where my question comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone seen this movie? And if so Does Danielle Fishel get naked in it? Would save me the 2 hours of my life i would never get back watching this terrible movie. Thanks a lot&#34;
b&#39;A plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the CEO\&#39;s daughter--goes down in thick forest in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is called off, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission. But just what is Knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oy, what a mess this film was! It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film. It suffers from two major flaws, and they\&#39;re probably both writer/director Jonas Quastel\&#39;s fault--this film (which I\&#39;ll be calling by its aka of Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I\&#39;ve ever seen next to Alone in the Dark (2005), and Quastel\&#39;s constant advice for the cast appears to have been, &#34;Okay, let\&#39;s try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The potential was there. Despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib The Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing Predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts. The monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes. The mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. The monster\&#39;s &#34;lair&#34; had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it\&#39;s a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, he thinks it\&#39;s a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, he doesn\&#39;t care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc. He just cuts to them at random. For that matter, the scenes we\&#39;re shown appear to be selected at random. Important events either never or barely appear, and we\&#39;re stuck with far too many pointless scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it\&#39;s not that important (the monster\&#39;s intelligence and &#34;humanity&#34; could have easily been shown in another way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she\&#39;s superfluous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, characters keep calling Harlan Knowles &#34;Mr. H&#34;, like they\&#39;re stereotypes of Asian domestics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, Quastel insists on using the &#34;Blurry Cam&#34; and &#34;Distorto-Cam&#34; for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn\&#39;t look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on, but you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this film better than I did\xc2\x97I\&#39;m a Henriksen fan, I\&#39;m intrigued by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but I just couldn\&#39;t. Every time I thought it was &#34;going to be better from this point until the end&#34;, Quastel made some other awful move. In the end, my score was a 3 out of 10.&#39;
b&#39;While I agree with the previous post that the cinematography is good, I totally disagree with the rest: This is nothing more than a porno movie disguised as an artsy film. Showing little boys naked is not art and amounts to child porn. Steer clear of this dud. Stupid is what this film is.&#39;
b&#34;Really? Is this necessary? How can somebody make such a film? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Stunts all the time, cars persecutions with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the Ending. Completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood!!! Well, at the beginning a fortune teller answers something, nobody has asked. Seagal&#39;s wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They must be kidding. Steven Segal passes out after a car persecution, and I know he can&#39;t act. It was terrible. Nothing can save that film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost 90 minutes of my life! See you&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;m surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year old were bored. The chipmunks are cute...but the storyline is overly obvious. Not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance; but I wondered why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t admit to ever being a &#39;chipmunks&#39; fan, but I expected to be entertained. It&#39;s not even an &#39;escapist&#39; movie as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy handed view of &#39;success too young spoils&#39;. We&#39;ve seen more than enough of that with Britney Spears, et al, haven&#39;t we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t bother.&#34;
b&#34;Absolutely inane film starring Abbott and Costello. Even our young children would become increasingly annoyed with this complete mess of a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abbott as Dinklepuss. What a look he had on his face. Sure, he had to be part of this dreadful film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did anyone notice that Costello&#39;s mother in the film sounded and looked like Fay Bainter? Luckily, for Ms. Bainter, that she wasn&#39;t in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is really no excitement hear for children. The jokes, if any, are quite stale. Some of the singing is nicely done but the lyrics are ridiculous.&#34;
b&#34;Ni\xc3\xb1as Mal is not a movie is a bad episode of a cheesy badly conceived soap opera. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is not a bit better of that in soap operas, I guess the writer and director has seen too many Mexican soap operas and can&#39;t conceive anything remotely different. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it up, go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop waisting our time and money and giving a bad name to the once respectable Mexican film industry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT an OK or good movie, it&#39;s a mediocre soap opera!&#34;
b&#39;Obviously, someone was looking at catching onto the &#34;Blair Witch&#34; wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was set up like all the &#34;reality&#34; haunted shows that are popping up on TV lately (and I must admit, I get a kick out of these), but this movie is MUCH cheesier! Probably the first three-quarters of the movie is filled with the &#34;participants&#34; going through the house, WHINING. Give me a break! Spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time. Any paranormal happenings are blatant setups. No strings, but too perfectly caught on camera to be real. The &#34;participants&#34; were not very likeable either. Two goofy guys who don\&#39;t take it seriously, one girl who scares at the drop of a hat, and the quintessential over-played &#34;paranormal&#34; person. Is this becoming the clich\xc3\xa9d-&#34;formula&#34; for a ghost movie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension. They took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes. I admit, I spent that time pacing in the kitchen. I really wouldn\&#39;t recommend this movie to younger viewers, even if it is PG13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;re looking for some entertainment, if you don\&#39;t take it seriously, you will get a kick out of this movie. There\&#39;s tons of situations to make cracks about! If you\&#39;re looking for an great story-line.. look elsewhere ;)&#39;
b&#34;Maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because I walked out well before the end. That&#39;s odd, because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed Midsummers Night&#39;s Dream once, many years ago, when I saw it on the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the Shakespearian name, Calista Flockhart, and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. Well, I suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren&#39;t, I&#39;d say we have a bad movie on our hands....&#34;
b&#34;i can&#39;t believe how dumb this movie truly is. the storyline (written by keira knightley&#39;s mother) is what ruins the movie to the extreme. it is straight out dull, absurd, and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this movie lagged so bad for most of it, especially at the beginning. the story just kept going on and on about their everyday flirts with each other, often times seeming like a threesome. in this movie, you have an annoying deadbeat couple (the poet and his wife) who are complete total drunks from the start. the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet, while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women. the wife, who waaayyyyyy too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover (played by keira) suddenly gets jealous, knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids. something doesn&#39;t seem right here....i mean, come on... get with the program lady! what&#39;d you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line is: former lovers meet again with new wife embracing it, then gets jealous, then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous, bombards the crazy drunk couple&#39;s home, crazy husband calls police, and they end up going to court for the man&#39;s attempted murder charges. that&#39;s it summed up in a nutshell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this movie had it&#39;s moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy, but other than that, i cannot believe i watched it... i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell asleep. i decided to give it a chance and i should have stuck to my first instincts.&#34;
b&#34;sorry, sorry but sorry. nice, very nice production, very nice actors, also funny. But, this type of the movies with a dog (Rex German, Gery-Jerry American) with a private detectives, with a pretty rich woman???????????????????????? Hello producer, how many movies we have out there with the same plot?????????? What do u have on your minds when you make the scenes like dog having a pupu. Or any king of that dog activities????? Micro chips who can make you rich? Micro chips who wort a fortune? There is three master chips, wow? And the creator of the chips can&#39;t make the same chips again? Hello, wake up. can give us something smarter than that? Best, D&#34;
b&#39;I just finished watching Disappearances at AFI FEST 2006 with about 30 other people in a mostly vacant 1000 seat auditorium. The festival programmer, after seeing the lack of audience, started his opening comments with, &#34;Well at least a few of those attending the festival have good taste in film&#34;. Well Mr. Programmer, after watching this film I must answer back &#34;No we don\&#39;t, and either do you!&#34; This &#34;back-woods&#34; period piece follows young (not so) Wild Bill as he and his mystic family dangerously run illegal Canadian whiskey across the border during America\&#39;s prohibition. The old-time outlaws (Kris Kristofferson and company) not only need the money to save their ramshackle Vermont farm but want to introduce little Wild Bill to the virtues of manhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although handsomely photographed, this adventure story lacks what makes films of this sort good, &#34;tension&#34; and believability. Kristofferson\&#39;s lackluster performance and dry monologue reminds me of a dream I once had where Al Gore was playing the role of Willy Wonka. I just didn\&#39;t care and when Wild Bills mystic grandmother appears out of thin air to give him advice it just didn\&#39;t fit. Yes, I almost fell asleep more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Farmer does do a good job as the Cameron Frye in Ferris Bueller character; brother-in-law of Big Bill while the teenage Chris McDermott does uses those piercing blue eyes to his acting benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall expect to see Jay Cravens Disappearances playing at a Block Buster $2 Bin near you.&#39;
b&#39;The brands in this film, like Suit Supply, take away from the story, cause it\&#39;s supposed to be set in the eighties. It\&#39;s not a very thrilling film. Also, the single from Intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus that is repeated numerous times\&#39;, like &#34;I\&#39;m a cruel man, I take it all away, I\&#39;m a cruel man I\&#39;m here to stay..&#34; Jeeez couldn\&#39;t those asswipes have come up with something better than that? I guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s really annoying, just like the product placement in this filmproduct,that cashes in on the controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity like he is now made out to be, but should be forgotten like rats ought to be.&#39;
b&#34;I seem to remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out, but had avoided seeing it throughout the years. I wish I&#39;d waited longer. Maybe this movie was funny in 1988, I don&#39;t know. I was younger then, but it didn&#39;t seem like the world was that different. Michelle Pfeiffer, lovely as she is, is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews scenery, but stuffs it in her cheeks like a gerbil to save for later. Dean Stockwell is about as convincing as a mob boss as James Gandolfini would be as principal dancer for the Bolshoi. And Matthew Modine demonstrated the most pronounced case of delayed puberty I&#39;ve ever seen. All in all, it&#39;s not bad enough to make you want to pluck out your eyes with a melon-baller, but it&#39;s not far off.&#34;
b&#39;I watched this one mostly to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot has many a twist and turn -- it\&#39;s not bad as a straight mystery aboard a train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why throw in a circus train wreck and an escaped gorilla? I can mention this without it being a &#34;spoiler&#34; because the circus train wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate mystery plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad person trying to kill the good people has many tricks up his sleeve, but the circus train wreck was purely coincidental. It allows for a single scene with a menacing gorilla, but then it\&#39;s back to the murder mystery!&#39;
b&#34;Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director, but he has made some undeniably important films. Kids, Bully, and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, revulsion, and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched upon similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. Irrefutably, all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skateboarders from South-Central Las Angeles who go to arbitrarily go to Beverly Hills to skate. That&#39;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wassup Rockers is nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no substance. It has an essentially nonexistent narrative. And, like Kids, it features a cast of first-time actors who were drawn out of the films setting. However, unlike Kids, none of them have any semblance of talent. There is better acting in porn. This film features, without a doubt, the most terrible performances I&#39;ve ever seen in a feature film. One can respect Larry Clark to exposing these young men to the film-making process, but these kids are absolutely cringe-worthy, folks. Might I add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack, which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you&#39;ll ever hear- my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater, or you&#39;ll regret it afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then again, it&#39;s not like they had much of a script to work with. Every line that is uttered is a contrived, pathetically-delivered, and irritating beyond all measure. The story itself is ludicrous. It starts out reasonably enough, but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity. This begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clich\xc3\xa9d National Lampoonish encounters, characters being killed off for no reason, and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax. Shots go on much longer than they need to. Be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight, overlong, lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets. But then again, with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible. Perhaps Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I could go on like this. This is the worst film Larry Clark has made yet. For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics, look elsewhere. This is by far the tamest film he&#39;s made yet, and it&#39;s also the worst. It&#39;s flat out horrible. Like, Uwe Boll horrible. Definitely the worst one I saw at the festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/10&#34;
b&#39;I was so &#34;impressed&#34; with Tim Kincaid\&#39;s MUTANT HUNT that I gave this one a try. It is the near future, post apocalypse of course. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge The Dark One and his underling Valaria. Along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clunky robots. Oh my! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is hardly up (or down) to HUNT\&#39;s level. Clocking in at a painful 79 minutes (the box says 90), this is one cheap flick. The sets have all the elaborate design of a carnival haunted house and the costumes prove that in the near future everyone will dress like John Travolta in the final dance number of STAYING ALIVE. The atomic wasteland is a combination of rubble filled old buildings and Central Park. The Dark One\&#39;s headquarters is ominously named The Power Station and looks like, well, a power station. The acting is universally bad except for Angelika Jager as the evil Valaria. Jager is a whole \&#39;nother level of bad. Vit er sick Cherman acczent, she gives a performance so amazingly bad that it becomes the sole reason to recommend this film. She also delivers the film\&#39;s only nudity in the &#34;pleasure chamber&#34; section of the film. Ed French again supplies the robot effects but they aren\&#39;t nearly as slimy as his work in MUTANT HUNT.&#39;
b&#39;Masterpiece. Carrot Top blows the screen away. Never has one movie captured the essence of the human spirit quite like &#34;Chairman of the Board.&#34; 10/10... don\&#39;t miss this instant classic.&#39;
b&#39;...But not this one! I always wanted to know &#34;what happened&#34; next. We will never know for sure what happened because GWTW was Margaret\&#39;s baby. I am a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind and I could not have been more repulsed by the movie. I did compare &#34;Scarlett&#34; to the original GWTW because any film worth following GWTW needed to be on the same quality level as the first. Rhett was cast beautifully, although NO ONE will ever compare to Mr. Gable. I am also a strict Vivien Leigh fan!! She WAS Scarlett. She fit the bill. Not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with &#34;Scarlett&#34; the job could have been done better. Not enough thought went into finding the proper Scarlett, that was evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction. This movie is not worth the time.&#39;
b&#39;Academy Awarding actor Sidney Poitier of &#34;Lilies of the Field&#34; reprises his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs from the 1967 Oscar winning Best Picture &#34;In the Heat of the Night&#34; for veteran director Gordon Douglas\&#39; tired, uninspired sequel &#34;They Call Me MISTER Tibbs,&#34; with nobody the equivalent of Rod Steiger with which to swap dialogue. Clearly, both &#34;Bullitt&#34; scenarist Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb of &#34;Cape Fear&#34; were off their game when they penned this predictable police procedural potboiler. The dialogue is drab and none of the characters are interesting, not even the chief suspect. Absolutely nothing remotely exciting, suspenseful, or surprising occurs in this tame whodunit. Meanwhile, things have changed considerably since Virgil was last seen in &#34;In the Heat of the Night.&#34; He worked as a homicide detective for the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Police Department. In &#34;They Call Me MISTER Tibbs,&#34; our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department. Moreover, he has a wife, Valerie (Barbara McNair of &#34;Change of Habit&#34;), and a family, a young rebellious son, Andy (George Spell of &#34;The Naked Kiss&#34;), and a younger doting daughter, Ginger (Wanda Spell of &#34;Hickey and Boggs&#34;). Tibbs drives a medium blue Mustang and his wife holds down the house and hovers over their two children since he doesn\&#39;t have as much time to spend with them. Literally, there are no surprises in this pedestrian murder mystery. Indeed, the best thing about &#34;They Call Me MISTER Tibbs&#34; is Quincy Jones\&#39; terrific orchestral soundtrack with a memorable opening theme, more memorable than this forgettable crime thriller deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything begins sensationally enough with a struggling prostitute, Joy Sturges (Linda Towne of &#34;The Adventurers&#34;), being bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of her downtown apartment by an unseen assailant. Apartment handyman Mealie Williamson (Juano Hernandez of &#34;Intruder in the Dust&#34;) enters Joy\&#39;s apartment and finds her strewn on the carpet dead with a bloody forehead. He picks up the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and reports Joy\&#39;s death to the superintendent of the apartment, Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe of &#34;License to Kill&#34;), and Weedon gives Mealie and fistful of dollars and sends him packing. Afterward, Weedon anonymously notifies the SFPD that popular minister Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau of &#34;Nevada Smith&#34;) beaten Joy to death and was seem leaving Joy\&#39;s apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of &#34;True Grit&#34;) assigns Tibbs to handle the case; it seems that both Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Naturally, Tibbs\&#39; wife Valerie cannot believe that the well-known, politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. Just to give the movie context, it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word \&#39;semen,\&#39; no doubt a controversial term to mention in an early 1970s movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tibbs questions Weedon whom he suspects is either a drug pusher or a pimp. Weedon explains that he has no records on Joy Sturges because she was subletting the apartment from another realty company. Tibbs visits the realty company and realtor Woody Garfield (Ed Anser of &#34;JFK&#34;) flees and drives off, essentially doing an O.J. Simpson until he crashes his car after a lengthy but tame pursuit. When Tibbs proves that Woody didn\&#39;t kill Joy, he allows him to leave, with his disgruntled wife, Marge (Norma Crane of &#34;Penelope&#34;), prepared to file for divorce after the revelation that he paid a hooker to stay in an apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tibbs tracks down handyman Mealie and clears him of the crime, and then he goes after Weedon. Luckily, for Tibbs, our hero catches the evil Weedon in the middle of a narcotics transaction. One of Weedon\&#39;s henchmen assaults Tibbs, but Tibbs dispenses with him briefly before he embarks on a long foot chase after Weedon. Eventually, he corners Weedon in an underground parking garage and they shoot it out. Guess who wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenes in the Tibbs\&#39; household are more interesting than his investigation. Andy runs rampant, striking his sister, and smoking in the garden. Our hero wants him to clean up his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs pops him three times on the jaw. These child rearing scenes could probably never be handled today as they were back in 1970. At the end of the movie, as if to solidify the family sequence, Tibbs is seen walking off with his wife and kids. There is on confrontation between Valerie and Virgil about the welfare of their children and how his long hours at work has affected them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Gordon Douglas directs in competent fashion. Surprisingly, for a film released in 1970, the filmmakers never play the race card. In one scene, when Tibbs searches a billiards parlor owned by an African-American, we see a mixed breed of races scowling at the hero when he finds Mealie and leaves with him in tow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, &#34;They Call Me MISTER Tibbs&#34; is a poor follow-up to &#34;In the Heat of the Night.&#34; Mind you, Poitier delivers another fine performance with nuance, but everything looks prefabricated. All of the sets look fake and there isn\&#39;t much physical violence: one underground parking lot shoot-out that doesn\&#39;t last long and a fight. Beyond Jones\&#39; seminal jazz score, the only surprise\xc2\x97and it really doesn\&#39;t qualify as a major surprise more like a convenient contrivance\xc2\x97is the ending. Donald Medford\&#39;s &#34;The Organization&#34; followed &#34;They Call Me MISTER Tibbs&#34; as the second, more action-packed sequel.&#39;
b&#34;So tell me - what serious boozer drinks Budweiser? How many suicidally-obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy&#39;s bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast? And what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face? Not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend&#39;s tits with it, just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of Elisabeth Shue&#39;s assets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while Shue looks more like a Berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker. She is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings, skin lacerations, anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clich\xc3\xa9d sentimental sexual fantasy of the &#39;tart-with-a-heart&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still - I did watch it to the end, by which time I was actually laughing out loud as Shue&#39;s tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly, pathetically smiling while Cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour...&#34;
b&#39;I thought i could see something good but... I am tired after seeing this movie, i don\&#39;t know what i hated the most: the script, the acting, the FX or the music. Try to picture the worst Power Rangers episode and would still be to kind. I\&#39;ve seen better FX in FPS Games( The touch with the bone sword or his breath that is making the people disappear in a green smoke is touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. I did liked how the women in the car was screaming, when the &#34;monster&#34; was walking around the car (even if she\&#39;s looking in the wrong way). So give your self a break and don\&#39;t watch this thing, at least call somebody up to see a horror movie with you, trust me you will end up playing monopoly for some kicks.&#39;
b&#39;I bought this movie hoping that it would be another great killer toy movie. I am a big fan of the Child\&#39;s Play series and was hoping to see the same here. Boy, was I wrong. Most of the movie was not the least bit scary, plus the only time we really see Pinocchio &#34;alive&#34; is the final few scenes of the film. The little girl in the film, her acting is so bad it\&#39;s almost laughable. Plus, the ending never showed what happened to the puppet or what made them put the little girl in a asylum or wherever she was at the end of the film. So, in my opinion this movie is the worst of the &#34;killer toy&#34; genre. If you want a good killer toy series, stick with the Child\&#39;s Play franchise. Pinocchio\&#39;s Revenge is a waste of money and time.&#39;
b&#39;this really is an &#34;okay&#34; series.. everyone in it is pretty good. but i just can\&#39;t take Reba. she\&#39;s trying to be funny but she just isn\&#39;t and then she got a stupid accent!! if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before, Reba IS destroying the show. however the 20 year old guy (dont know his name) but he\&#39;s soooo funny, and he\&#39;s really saving it all..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so here\&#39;s the recipe to get a great show. kick Reba of it and then put the 20 year old guy into the lead role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks (like me) that they should kick Reba of the show and put someone else in the lead role&#39;
b&#39;This movie stunk. There is not much more to it. The final fight looked like Walker taking on my grandmother, not some supernatural demon with the strength of ten men. I found the commercials more interesting. The plot twists and jokes could be seen coming a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this film was that it ended. Avoid this at all costs...unless you enjoy bad Chuck Norris movies.&#39;
b&#34;Down at the Movie Gallery, I saw a flick I just had to see. It looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that I could get into. Yeah, I knew it would suck, but I rented it anyway hoping for laughs. Only a few laughs were to be found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film. He looks/acts like he could take on Chuck Norris, but he can&#39;t. His dialogue sucks too. Anyway, he goes into a village, shoots some zombies. You could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes 3-5 minutes to reload or watch some zombies. At least the zombies look cool. So anyway, some people get shot, some zombies die, and in the end, everyone is dead except our main character, who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people.&#34;
b&#39;I like Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the movie wasn\&#39;t good at all. There wasn\&#39;t a likable character in the picture, and the plot was nearly non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Masterson is a great actress, but she just didn\&#39;t pull off the &#34;tough girl&#34; character. (She had similar problems with her character in THE SECOND DAY OF Christmas.) Perhaps she should avoid these characters, especially those with an obnoxious female child to play off of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evan Rachel Wood was unimpressive. Her character was a brat, plain and simple, and no young actress could have given Harriet any positive feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of full disclosure, I couldn\&#39;t even finish watching this picture. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough to waste.&#39;
b&#34;Please, do not waste your time and money with this stinker of a turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an over-the-top melodramatic love story set against the background of New France (aka Quebec in the 18th century). Or is it an historical saga of New France with an epic romance thrown in? I don&#39;t know, and at this point I don&#39;t care anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a rich story to be told out there about the intrepid French adventurers, rogues and other assorted characters who settled Canada and parts of the US. This is not it. The characters are total clich\xc3\xa9s, the story is overblown, breathless and devoid of any charm, and before long all the viewer wants to do is get the heck out of the theatre, have his or her head checked, and get hold of his or her anger at being taken in by the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema, especially since, as an historian and a French Canadian or Canadian of French descent (or whatever) I am a) a believer in the fact that the story of my people in this country has yet to be told as well as it could on film b) interested in this subject c) a film-lover who thinks cinema these days could do wonders with this grandiose and tragic story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, do not waste your time with this frustrating bit of claptrap.&#34;
b&#34;Extremely formulaic with cosmic-sized logic holes and a pretense at comedy. Aw, poor NYC lawyer! He&#39;s just scraping by, and when he gets a reduction in pay he doesn&#39;t go out to find another job, though he&#39;s one of the most respected lawyers in the area. We see him arguing in court so that others come up and congratulate him on his fiery, winning delivery, but he can&#39;t stand up to anyone in his firm. At home, problems are ignored until people storm out of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only character you want to root for is the final maid, who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. How laughable that the maid should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on New Year&#39;s Eve because she feels sorry for them! (The bit&#39;s not played for laughs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, just too unbelievable and with a **SPOILER** pat, everyone-turns-180-degrees ending. How&#39;d they get top-notch stars for this? If I&#39;d been at the studio I&#39;d have sent this one back for a complete rewrite.&#34;
b&#34;This movie was horrible. If it had never been made the world would be a better place. Come on, a flying wagon? What were they thinking? This was a sub-par movie with a horrible hook, and I would like a written apology from the studio that produced this, along with some cookies to help repay me for the time I wasted on this crap fest that I can never get back. If you payed to see this movie, I am truly sorry because I watched it on TV on a Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do and it pretty much ruined my whole week. A flying freaking WAGON?!?! And that&#39;s supposed to make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own screwed up needs than her children? No wonder they don&#39;t have enough sense to tell someone he is beating them, their mother teaches them nothing but that what she wants comes before everything else. Absolutely horrible.&#34;
b&#39;I know everyone said this movie was utter crap and I agree with them. I spent a few years after seeing it telling other people it was crap. I recommended they not see it. But when it came on TV, we saw the ad. I turned to family and said: &#34;I know this is sad, but I\&#39;m thinking of watching it&#34;. My sister turned to me and said: &#34;Yeah, me too.&#34; And you know what? It was funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By no means is this a good movie. It\&#39;s absolutely a waste of time. But it\&#39;s a good waste of time. You may still think it\&#39;s crap and fair enough, but I thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy. I didn\&#39;t like a couple of bits, like when the fish got hit by the car, but apart from that I thought it was good. I loved sitting there and picking out all the famous Australian faces: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you like to waste your time, watch this movie. Otherwise, see a drama or something.&#39;
b&#34;What&#39;s the point of this film? It&#39;s totally forgettable. Unless you have a serious bunny fetish, look elsewhere. So the bunnies had a merit/demerit list. No chewing gum in front of the customers. Are we supposed to find that interesting?&#34;
b&#39;Unfortunately, I went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information I had seen on Fandango. Since I am a sci-fi buff the notion of a movie about UFOs interested me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical Christian propaganda flick. Appropriate for an audience of like-minded individuals but very un-Christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci Code did not hold back its wild-eyed craziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this B-grade movie (and I am being kind) production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs, probably shown to Wednesday and Sunday evening youth groups. But if you are a mainline Christian or non-Christian you will not be comfortable.&#39;
b&#39;Might end up being the biggest disappointment that I will see in 2009. I seem to be the rare person who disliked Park\&#39;s Oldboy, but I think that his &#34;Lady Vengeance&#34; and &#34;Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance&#34; are among the best films I\&#39;ve seen in the 2000\&#39;s decade. Therefore, I really was looking forward to see this, especially as it got such positive reviews. Instead, I found the film clich\xc3\xa9d, and broke little, if any new ground to the vampire genre. And while I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this, I felt Park did this at very inopportune times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have compared/contrasted this to &#34;Let the Right One In,&#34; and I have to say that &#34;Let the Right One In&#34; was far superior to this one, and was a fresh take on the vampire genre. Sadly, Park\&#39;s take was a tired one.&#39;
b&#34;National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie&#39;s Island Adventure (2003) Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. Embarrassing direct-to-video flop has oafish Cousin Eddie and family on an expenses-paid vacation to the South Pacific by his boss, hoping the dunce won&#39;t sue his company after being bitten by a smarter lab monkey! Idiotic spin off can&#39;t measure up to any of the Vacation films (even European Vacation!), with a question of whether or not the filmmakers thought the script was actually funny. Not even Quaid, Willard, or Asner can make it remotely watchable. 83 min., Not rated. *&#34;
b&#39;This was more of a love story than one about an angel who comes down here to earth, although both angles of that story are given a good share of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I took this movie to heart, as someone who knows and believes the Bible, I would have canned it pretty quick, but I don\&#39;t think the general atmosphere was either mean-spirited or blasphemous. It was just ludicrous or just plain stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, John Travolta as a grubby angel? Smoking? Scratching his groin? Quoting the Beatles? A &#34;warring angel&#34; who knows nothing about Heaven? An angel who flirts with all the women? Yes, it\&#39;s all absurd and certainly Biblically- incorrect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could tolerate all that but I don\&#39;t know how many people, whatever beliefs they hold, who could stand a boring film which this turned out to be during the second half of it. It begins to drag when the romance begins between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell. Some of the dialog during that romance is so stupid it\&#39;s insulting to any discriminating viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another Nora Ephron-directed film. Man, I can\&#39;t believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed. At least she\&#39;s consistent.&#39;
b&#39;This \&#39;documentary\&#39; sheds absolutely no light on what it would be like to be backstage during the Hard Knock Life tour. Granted, I wasn\&#39;t there, but watching this film didn\&#39;t make me feel like I was. And for a film like this, that\&#39;s not exactly a compliment. The whole time I watched it, all I could think was, &#34;What are they leaving out?&#34; When it\&#39;s all over, the only rapper you feel like you have some insight into is DMX, and that\&#39;s mainly because he just talks about his dogs. A waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10&#39;
b&#39;I don\&#39;t think this movie had the effect on me that was intended: seeing American soldiers shooting wounded soldiers from the other side, and punching wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them into making them talk made me root for the other side. It certainly made the US forces look anything like &#34;the good guys&#34;. Was this supposed to be acceptable?&#39;
b&#39;Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clich\xc3\xa9s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I\&#39;m sure the book was bad, but it can\&#39;t have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow &#34;Tuscan&#34; lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn\&#39;t Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You\&#39;ve never seen the white marble of Rome\&#39;s Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look.&#39;
b&#39;again such kind of zero-budget digital-video cam trash. and again I fell into this trap cuz the title had &#34;zombie&#34; in it (german title: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) the story: on halloween some people visit the &#34;museum of the dead&#34;, it\&#39;s a trap, a crazy doctor wants to kill the people, everything connected to some aztec-cult. so they fight against some zombies in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ultra cheap scenery: some corridors with black tape on it. a few dilettantish drawings and a few skulls as you can find them in every fun-shop. no actors, just low-grade models waking around with absolutely no idea what to do. no effects. laughable make-up, your local hobby-make-up-zombie-fan will do it better, some time it looked as if they had not enough money for enough colour, otherwise they just could not do it like this, man, they have to realize the looks of their &#34;zombies&#34;. some laughable martial-arts fights with the zombies, slow-motion. just, when the director wants to have it scary he uses some standard digital-video-cam effect where everything is flackering. unbelievable! 0 out of 10!&#39;
b&#39;Although the film does have a fairly stylish look for an indie made on a really low budget, that\&#39;s not what I go to movies for. There wasn\&#39;t one character I found sympathetic, they all seemed to be absolutely clueless losers. Everything they attempt ends badly, it\&#39;s all too hopeless for me. Reviews refer to the Puffy Chair as a black comedy...comedy? The brother Rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution. When Josh talks to girl friend Emily about his brother, he almost hints at Rhett not playing with a full deck. Nonetheless Josh performs a &#34;wedding&#34; for Rhett and a woman Rhett met just a few hours before. There were a few interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road. However for me the most telling thing was that people were walking out of the film...and I saw it at a free screening.&#39;
b&#34;When I put this movie in my DVD player, and sat down with a coke and some chips, I had some expectations. I was hoping that this movie would contain some of the strong-points of the first movie: Awsome animation, good flowing story, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and a kick-ass soundtrack. But, to my disappointment, not any of this is to be found in Atlantis: Milo&#39;s Return. Had I read some reviews first, I might not have been so let down. The following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first movie, and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the first scene appears, your in for a shock if you just picked Atlantis: Milo&#39;s Return from the display-case at your local videoshop (or whatever), and had the expectations I had. The music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one. (With the exception of a few characters, like the voice of Sweet). The actual drawings isnt that bad, but the animation in particular is a sad sight. The storyline is also pretty weak, as its more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time. But dont misunderstand, it&#39;s not very good Schooby-Doo episodes. I didnt laugh a single time, although I might have sniggered once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the audience who haven&#39;t seen the first movie, or don&#39;t especially care for a similar sequel, here is a fast review of this movie as a stand-alone product: If you liked schooby-doo, you might like this movie. If you didn&#39;t, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect it might be a good kids movie, but I wouldn&#39;t know. It might have been better if Milo&#39;s Return had been a three-episode series on a cartoon channel, or on breakfast TV.&#34;
b&#39;Although the movie was only so so the closed captioning was by far the best I have ever seen! Most of the time the spelling is terrible and the captioning out of sync. I use the closed captioning even though I can hear well but find a lot of actors mumble. Also many times the sound track overrides the dialogue. Thanks!&#39;
b&#34;I can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attended the UK premiere last night. Zane and Brook attended (they probably knew I was gonna be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey of a film. I felt sorry for them at times, when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious &#39;thriller&#39; scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But perhaps I was missing the point. Perhaps an element of tongue-in-cheek was intended. If so, pure genius. If not, career genocide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, Zane always shines, and Brook can actually act a little. As the other half said (as we ran out the cinema, avec broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people! The scriptwriter, however, should be marooned.&#34;
b&#39;If regarded as an independent feature I can\&#39;t say it\&#39;s too bad at all but from where I\&#39;m standing this sequel and the original &#34;Lady and the Tramp&#34; don\&#39;t agree with each other! They are two completely different movies with different style, different voice personalities, different narratives and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals (e.g. the town-house of Jim Dear, Darling, Lady and Tramp) and none of those have changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;re seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like &#34;Bella Notte&#34; and &#34;The Siamesse Cats Song&#34; this sequel won\&#39;t give you any at all! Just about every song has a little pop to it and those good old characters like Jock and Trusty, Jim Dear and Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats may well be seen but they\&#39;re seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters, not to mention Peg not appearing at all, whose voices are quite annoying. Even Lady and Tramp don\&#39;t appear often enough and as for Scamp?! He is so spoilt! And treats his father Tramp with utter disrespect, then runs away with no remorse even after hearing how much he\&#39;s being missed at home! And they called his shameless getaway an adventure! I\&#39;d say Scott Wolf truly brought out the abusive bad boy in Scamp wiping out the typical cute Disney animal. Even the old characters just drive you mad in this; Trusty sounds like Goofy sick in bed, Jock (Jeff-stupid-Bennett) - and his VOICE - sound neither Scottish nor worth hearing! Zap him off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb, feather-brained, EXASPERATING JUNKYARD DOGS!!!!!! Somebody put them down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Lady and the Tramp 2&#34; isn\&#39;t completely bad if you\&#39;re not already having a tough day but I expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic - Scamp is chavvy, so is his girlfriend Angel and there is a feeble storyline. Still, I think you should try it at least once because, as I say, there are much worse movies around.&#39;
b&#39;Respected western auteur Budd Boetticher is woefully out of place with this choppy modern day cops and robbers story that suffers from a strong lack of emotional believability. Boetticher seems to have waived rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leads Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming put little effort into their roles, delivering lines flatly and without energy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild mannered employee Leon &#34;Foggy&#34; Poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process. He escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his. Hundreds of cops are mobilized to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but wouldn\&#39;t you know in the films final moments we have Foggy trailing feet behind the victim (who thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move) while a company of cops observe and bicker over what action to take. Sound preposterous? You should see it. It\&#39;s all of that and more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucien Ballard\&#39;s camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs but the editing is lackadaisical and shapeless and it drains the film of its suspense and pace. As Poole, Wendell Corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer. These attributes aside Killer uniformly fails in construction and execution making its message clear. Go Western old Budd.&#39;
b&#39;This movie clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: Never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). Let\&#39;s shun everything that\&#39;s on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else, let\&#39;s pretend all &#34;gringos&#34; are evil, satanic, or drug dealers. All that is outside one\&#39;s country\&#39;s border (and specially US borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else. The &#34;based on true events&#34; is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or, in this case, just to help pushing the film\&#39;s ideology down some na\xc3\xafve throats out there. The perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories: Mexicans into disgusting people, Mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops, republicans into the right-wing morons, democrats into almost hippie humanists and so forth. Is there anything good about the film? I hardly think so, but may be you think differently.&#39;
b&#39;I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: I was not impressed, not at all. I do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the discussion board, I found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. It says: &#34;\&#39;Deed Poll\&#39; is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes. The brilliant acting of Barbara Kowa and Andr\xc3\xa9 Schneider, the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work (Steffen Ritter) make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips (especially in sound). However, the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains.&#34; Unfortunately, this is true. I wasn\&#39;t intrigued by the story at all. The protagonists are cold, ambition-less people. They do a lot of drugs and have a lot of (incestuous) sex. So what? For many times, the direction seemed to be virtually non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What\&#39;s the point of the movie? What\&#39;s the message behind it all? The anonymous reviewer said: &#34;Somehow Biermann failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in mid-air without a message. Thus the boredom I blame on the movie. The movie is reserved and emotionless, cold, almost neutral and it doesn\&#39;t take long to see the flaws: for long stretches the characters of Sean and Ivy are not credible (they clearly have difficulties with the English pronunciation), the character of the mute brother is not developed very well. Some moments are very promising though - in the scene where the call boy is skinned (the one and only true love scene) an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long. As a spectator one has to regret the chances given away.&#34; Again, I must agree. I did like the final scene, especially because of the beautifully captured faces of Gianni Meurer and Andr\xc3\xa9 Schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom I had to suffer for the first thirty minutes. (The sex scenes, though, were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, &#34;Deed Poll&#34; was not my cup of tea - a good, controversial idea wasted -, but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money. Maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, this would have become a better movie.&#39;
b&#34;Well, since it&#39;s called Porno Holocaust and directed by Joe D&#39;Amato, I went into this film expecting sleaze...and while I somewhat got it, Porno Holocaust was a massive disappointment as it&#39;s just so damned BORING. The title suggests that the film will feature porn, and that&#39;s not wrong - Porno Holocaust is pretty much just porn, and most of it is just the same stuff over and over again, I was fast forwarding before the end. The first sex scene is between two women and it got my hopes up, but after that it just degenerates into normal porn, and the rest of the film (for the first hour!) is made up of talking, and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through! The plot focuses on a deserted island where, believe it or not, something strange is going on. Naturally, it&#39;s not long before a group of people - made up of a few men and some scientists, who all happen to be sexy women, land on the island. They have sex a few times and some strange things happen, then over an hour later they&#39;re attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladies...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This must have seemed like a good idea for an original porno - a zombie who likes to get it on, but unsurprisingly it doesn&#39;t work well at all. The film clocks in at just ten minutes short of the two hour mark, and that is far too long for a film like this. I have no idea why Porno Holocaust is as long as it is; if they&#39;d just snipped one minute out of every sex scene, the film would have been under ninety minutes, and that would have made it much more tolerable! The zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear (it&#39;s quite a long time before there&#39;s a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place), and when it does finally appear, it&#39;s a huge disappointment! I realise that this is low budget B-movie trash, but D&#39;Amato surely could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this! I&#39;m not even going to bother mentioning the acting, atmosphere etc, there&#39;s no point. Porno Holocaust is basically just your average dull porn flick with a slight sprinkling of horror, and I can&#39;t recommend it!&#34;
b&#34;This vicious little film is horrendous. My low rating for it comes for two main reasons. The first is that it is an animal snuff film and I find that whole concept so vile it turns my stomach. Filmed over a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we&#39;ve evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate. This film is complete and utter exploitation, made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject. Historical interest aside, this is something to watch only if one finds themselves in the grip of morbid fascination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason number two? Look at the way that the camera is set up. It is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the full effect: long march forward of the elephant, perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate viewpoint of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses. Sickening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence aren&#39;t in doubt. Nobody is perfect, but when you realize that this film provided A) an opportunity for him to trump early cinematic competitors with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted and B) he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of DC as opposed to AC, you can&#39;t help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little TOO dispassionate and cold. Any number of Peter Cushing&#39;s mad scientists would be proud. The rest of us should be ashamed and revolted.&#34;
b&#39;I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake. The DVD version titled &#34;The One-Armed Swordsmen&#34; was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don\&#39;t rent or buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. Much as I liked seeing Wang Yu in his prime again after all these years, this one is an utter waste of time. I\&#39;ve had dish detergents that made a better film than this. What the chopped-up DVD version shows us is that no matter how silly a Chinese script may be, you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &#34;The One-Armed Swordsmen&#34; does offer you do the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh beating up smirking pretty boy David Chiang -- it\&#39;s always a pleasure to see that happen. Lo plays a sort of second-string villain here, and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. he film is also graced by the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as the magistrate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene (there are two, in fact) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons, making Bruce Lee noises while they fight. None of this makes any sense, but that\&#39;s okay if you\&#39;re not expecting any clarity or common sense. It was fun to watch anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters. There are a couple of female roles, but they play no serious role in the action or the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one which explains why he has only the one arm and why he uses a broken sword, go for it.&#39;
b&#39;Why does this piece of film have so many raving reviews? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is amateurish, unfunny and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only memorable thing here is the corny title song. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The production values are low and the &#34;comedic&#34; (if you want to call them that) ideas are weak, they seem like leftovers of leftovers from SNL that even they would not dare to have put on the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m beginning to thoroughly mistrust IMDb ratings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is light years away from Kentucky Fried Movie - not even in the same Galaxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not even possible to write 10 lines about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people - something one doesn\&#39;t get to see a lot in todays TV and Movies.&#39;
b&#39;The Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrey is good actor and he proved it in &#34;Man on the Moon&#34; and in &#34;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#34;. But hey, what can an actor do without good story and proper directing. He can do &#34;Number 23&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel Schumacher is poor, overrated director and he proved it in almost every movie he made. What he did with Batman is just disaster, but probably Batman movies supposed to look good. Well, they didn\&#39;t. Instead of Gothic and macabre we got Disneyland. Sure &#34;Falling Down&#34; was great but can You ruin the film with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas AND with excellent script? No You can\&#39;t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so good actor and poor director finally met and made &#34;Number 23&#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly (23)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that it\&#39;s stupid to begin with but... Fingerling\&#39;s subplot (almost half of this movie) looks exactly like intro to another chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, quality of detective story itself, quality of the characters, even colors, mood and music, editing, and sound mix too! Perhaps it works for the game, but surely it doesn\&#39;t in the cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mise en scene is so bad that it becomes funny. It\&#39;s not even annoying. Carrey reads walking down the stairs in park? Why? Is it natural? No, but it looks good. Why Suicide Blond covered walls in her apartment with white paper? If she just wanted to kill herself? There is no logic in that, but still it looks good. Guess what it, it doesn\&#39;t look good at all. It looks unnatural instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All female characters are Flat. Why is that so? Who cares, let\&#39;s go on with the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is this Fingerling? Private eye on the suicide? Hardly believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scenes when Walter Sparrow is arguing with his wife about weather book is really about him could be the best part of this movie. Instead we get Moulder/Scully routine. Disappointment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interiors has no sign of people living in them, except the significant objects (shoes, photos etc.) Hard luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dialogs ain\&#39;t that bad. But what about V.O.? Well that\&#39;s another story. &#34;There\&#39;s no such thing as destiny. There are only different choices&#34;. Captain obvious to the rescue! &#34;Number was coming after Fingerling. And now it was coming after me&#34;. Clich\xc3\xa9. And so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s obvious that average housewife would break into public building in the middle of the night. Successfully and undisturbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subplot of the dog dragging main character to the graveyard. This is so old trick and so comfortable for writer, and that it should have been banned. I mean it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flashbacks and editing similar to &#34;what happened in last episode of X-files&#34; isn\&#39;t the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie. Is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say that this story deserves a better fate, but it doesn\&#39;t. It makes no sense. Told in chronological order is weak and unbelievable. All the time we have undeveloped characters trapped is chain of situations which are nothing but badly written fiction. This could be fun, but - since whole movie is dead serious - it isn\&#39;t. To many coincidences is just bad for every story. And the &#34;mystery&#34;? It\&#39;s predictable and easy to guess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Losing touch with reality is great theme for good movie, but I never saw any of that in Hollywood\&#39;s productions. If You\&#39;re interested in the subject just watch &#34;Repulsion&#34; by Polanski or something by David Cronenberg, &#34;Spider&#34; or &#34;A History Of Violence&#34; both of that movies deals with similar problems that &#34;Number 23&#34; wanted to show. Wanted, but failed.&#39;
b&#39;The fact that this movie is bargain basement quality is a real shame, but back in the 1940s, that was about the only type of film made for theaters catering to Black audiences due to segregation. So, while MGM, Warner and all the other big studios were making extremely polished films, tiny studios with shoestring budgets were left to muddle by with what they had. And from seeing this movie, it\&#39;s obvious that a lot of energy went into making the film, even if it is a pretty lousy film aesthetically speaking. Some of the actors weren\&#39;t particularly good (especially the French guy), the sets were minimal and the plot totally silly BUT the film also had some good music--of varying styles from Classical to Jazz to Rhythm and Blues. This is thanks to many talented but pretty much unrecognized Black performers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for the plot, it was totally stupid and silly but still watchable in a kitschy way. I loved seeing Tim Moore (&#34;Kingfish&#34; from the AMOS \&#39;N ANDY TV show) in drag, as he made the absolute ugliest woman in cinema history (this includes the Bride of Frankenstein and many others)--this is probably due to the fact that when NOT in drag, he was a pretty ugly but funny guy. If the man pretending to be a woman actually looked remotely like a woman, I doubt this movie would have worked as well. Seeing this ugly and rubber-faced man with a cheesy wig STILL being ardently sought after by three suitors was pretty funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn\&#39;t a great film but from a historical point of view, it\&#39;s fascinating and excellent viewing for young adults to know what America was like for Blacks in this era. A very interesting and funny time capsule.&#39;
b&#39;1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn\&#39;t make a whole worthwhile experience. John Waters directed this music-filled spoof of the fifties scene with Johnny Depp playing the title role. This movie is very similar with what he did with the 60\&#39;s spoof entitled &#34;Hairspray&#34; but this one is not as effective. Some of the tunes are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky Waters-like way, and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone. The storyline is similar to the movie &#34;Grease&#34;, where there is a good group and a bad group. The guy from the bad group, Cry Baby, wow\&#39;s a girl from the good group. The good girl then joins the bad group but once Cry Baby hurts her -- she falls back to the good group. This just sets up the ending where Cry Baby tries to win her back. Now, one difference that is expected in Water\&#39;s movies is that the bad group doesn\&#39;t appear all that bad all the time and the good group acts like they have a pole up their you-know-what. I definitely saw this in Hairspray, as well. The wacky and goofiness isn\&#39;t really all that much fun in this movie, though and it just leaves us with a feeling like the movie could have been much better. The prime appeal of the Johnny Depp character is that he\&#39;s able to make one tear roll down his cheek(thus his namesake) at various times and makes the women fall all over the place for him. This is overused and the basic bottom line is that the movie is OK, but not that great.&#39;
b&#34;Ru Paul plays a secret agent called Starrbooty. She teams up with another drag queen agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne)and get her kidnapped niece back...or something like that. Seriously-- I had trouble concentrating on the plot! The movie is seemingly directed by somebody with severe ADD--quick camera cuts nonstop that make it impossible to focus on anything. The dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you can hear it you wish it remained incomprehensible! The acting is actually pretty OK except for Ru Paul who overacts to an embarrassing degree. Also the film is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just revolting and not even remotely funny. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, sick and just couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. I pride myself on sitting through anything but this went WAY beyond my limits! People are comparing this to the early work of John Waters. I disagree. Waters&#39; work is sick but good--this is just sick. Avoid.&#34;
b&#39;I really liked this quirky movie. The characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on TV. It has a realistic edge, with a captivating story line. The main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch.&#39;
b&#39;I don\&#39;t usually watch Hollywood dribble, but I was dragged along with some friends to see this one, which turned out to be amusing in places but totally devoid of any originality. Don\&#39;t worry, you won\&#39;t have to think - Tarantino-like storyline leaves enough over-obvious hints for us to correctly predict where this one\&#39;s going about fifteen minutes before every &#34;twist&#34; - I sat there worrying that the film was building up fairly nicely for a Hollywood flick but that it would have nowhere to go at the climax. And boy were my fears realised - YMCA couldn\&#39;t save this one, but Liv Tyler almost did. I suppose being male and in my twenties helped, but she delivered a really good performance - obviously she didn\&#39;t have to do much except look absolutely stunningly over-the-top sexy, but what she did she did well! McCOOL\&#39;S is certainly not going to go down as one of Hollywood\&#39;s great successes (or should I say &#34;shouldn\&#39;t&#34; because the mainstream American film industry is not going anywhere at present, and hasn\&#39;t for a decade at least, save the odd hit like AMERICAN BEAUTY, TITANIC and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and even those had major flaws), but if you\&#39;re a teen male, do yourself a favour and see Liv - she is one hot chick. Rating: 5/10. See also: anything by Quentin Tarantino, any American teen film over the last decade, anything with sex as its main selling point.&#39;
b&#39;This movie includes 2 well known actors I have previously enjoyed watching. There actions are great and each action is heart felt. But it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speech/drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind-humping to drive the audience into tears for her release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good part IS the acting abilities, the plot has the same ruse as Hitlers influence and I started to hate the protagonist for that. But all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion, so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#39;This mess starts off with a real tank running over a car, intercut with images of a toy tank. This is followed by a family driving home from a birthday party without saying anything. The unexplained tank and the untalkative family take up, I swear, over 10 minutes of film. Finally, the family sees a car after it has been in a wreck and decides to report it to the proper authorities, only to find that the citizens of the town are all hiding in their houses, and the cops are hiding in the police station. Interesting? Almost. When the town folk come out due to the family\&#39;s presence, we learn that both the writer and editor are conspiring to substitute suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hopes that the audience\&#39;s inability to tell what\&#39;s going on will somehow bring unease upon the audience... and it works! ... but not in the way they thought it would. I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all. The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense. Not in a fun David Lynch sort of way, but a sort of I-walked-in-during-the-middle-of-a-boring-conversation sort of way. Over the course of the next hour, we learn that the movie-makers try to bore us into being afraid by showing tediously mundane scenes combined with the above-mentioned &#34;what\&#39;s going on?&#34; type scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot involves something along the lines of gentle-looking old folks putting children into a trance through the power of Satan and then bringing them to a party to play with toys, and an even more sinister intention, and it\&#39;s up to a group of white men (everybody\&#39;s white in the movie) to grab their guns and save the day, and a tag-a-long eye candy woman who whines at the drop of a hat. They look for the kidnapped children by looking in random places and yelling the kids\&#39; names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great horror movie for any person who has never seen a horror movie because that person is frightened by the mere thought of Satanism, Paganism, Wicca, or even Catholicism due to a lifetime diet of brainwashing from the Trinity Broadcast Network. This represents Satanism as elderly folks in Halloween costumes with candles while mingling at a party, in front of an Ankh. Replete with a priest spouting completely made-up nonsense about Satanists, while calling them &#34;Witches.&#34; The message that anything that isn\&#39;t Protestantism can be all thrown into the same category for easy condemnation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of little green men for a solid 3 minutes, a family staring out of the windows of their car without talking for 10 minutes while listening to elevator muzak. A priest studying Satanism for 4 minutes with ooh-so-scary drawings of demons to scare the Church Lady crowd. Random shots of dolls. Random shots of children. Paint instead of blood at every chance. Film School level dream sequences. Introduces unimportant characters who do nothing before they exit. Sometimes, they act as if the Nothing that they\&#39;re doing is a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directing is sloppy at best. An example of the directing includes a scene at the beginning where a man and woman are kissing and the man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes and some dark red paint falls on her cheek. Looking up, they see that it\&#39;s not blood, but droplets from a girl\&#39;s snowcone. Snowcones are ice and colored / flavored water, and would not have produced droplets of the same texture as paint, not to mention the fact that her snowcone was a bright reddish-orange. Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing. It then cuts to an alternate shot of the man, woman, and girl and shows that she\&#39;s standing about four feet away from them, so the snowcone wouldn\&#39;t have dripped on the woman even if she\&#39;d held her snowcone out over the woman\&#39;s face. Way to go, editor! Of course, the acting is blah. The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director\&#39;s most offensive technique is to give the actors no motivation and then go out for lunch as the unblinking eye of the camera leers as the actors make fools of themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would\&#39;ve been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Nero&#34; as the title of the movie is in Germany is a another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate Nero than the amusing but completely fictitious Nero Peter Ustinov played in &#34;Quo Vadis!&#34; it still is a major failure. And to those IMDb-commentators who still believe that Sueton and Tacitus propaganda is true, please read a book about Nero that was published less than 20 years ago. Nero did NOT burn Rome, this is proved! He did not murder Britannicus. He did not torture, kill and maim for pleasure, he was the first emperor who BANNED the gladiator fights. The movie still shows a lot of mistakes, errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looking like some villa, the city itself looked like..well like a cheap set. The acting was between good and sub-par, the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon deteriorated after Nero became emperor to a rushed, bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure. So there still is the potential for an epic biography of Nero that shows the true Nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.&#39;
b&#39;Well, this may be one of the worst movies ever, but atleast there are some nice t*ts in it. The movie is a very bad spoof of The Blair Witch Project, and should be watched only by those wanting to see some t*ts, and NO point other than to flaunt them.&#39;
b&#34;Though the Our Gang comedies still have their followers, I&#39;ve got to say that their attempt to graduate to feature films, courtesy of Hal Roach came up way short. Why did Roach have to pick the Civil War as is subject with all the attendant racism that would follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dashing southern cavalier Phillips Holmes takes in young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky inadvertently exposes a card cheat on a riverboat. All is placid and serene in the Old South and then the Civil War comes to ruin it for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even children can charm the worst in the world and there&#39;s none worse than those damn Yankees. They just come south and ruin it for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Criticized though it was for its southern viewpoint, Gone With The Wind did make a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed even though servile which they would be out of necessity are still three dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won her Oscar if it were not so. Butterfly McQueen&#39;s character of Prissy as silly and vacuous as she was has some dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here though is maybe some of the worst racial stereotyping ever brought forth in Hollywood. The companionship of Spanky and Buckwheat does show that kids get along, racial feelings are acquired not inbred. It&#39;s not the servility of the blacks that&#39;s objectionable, but there total acceptance of it. Right from that horrible watermelon song, sung over the title credits, the message of General Spanky is a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it did get an Oscar nomination for Sound recording, probably one of the very few Hal Roach ever got out of the short subject field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Spanky is far from Gone With The Wind though.&#34;
b&#39;Think of an extremely low-rent version of &#34;Heathers,&#34; and you\&#39;ve got &#34;Pep Squad.&#34; That sums up the flick in a nutshell. I must give credit where credit\&#39;s due, though. The film has a nice visual appeal to it. I liked the cinematography, I liked the wild color schemes, I liked the costume designs. But without good acting, a film has no redeeming value. I\&#39;d rather watch a film with little visual appeal, with good actors and sharp dialogue (i.e.: &#34;The Brothers McMullen&#34; or any Edward Burns film). The actors either recite their dialogue in monotones or scream it out like they\&#39;re in a bad soap opera. This is why I don\&#39;t badmouth most mainstream actors. Let\&#39;s face it, most actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason. If they\&#39;re not &#34;great&#34; actors, they\&#39;re at least competent. People badmouth Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites the dialogue as if he\&#39;s reading it off the page? It\&#39;s a shame, because the director seems like he knows his stuff when it comes to mis en scene (sp). At the same time I can\&#39;t totally praise Steve Balderson (the director). He did write the screenplay, which contains some horrible dialogue. He might be slightly racist too, since there\&#39;s a black principal in the movie, who inhabits a culmination of African-American stereotypes.&#39;
b&#34;I watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn&#39;t bag out that one, though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going. The effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I borrowed this one with an open mind, i am also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champ) and was hoping it was a decent movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was i wrong, the movie sucked, the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary, the storyline was SO predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode, as i already would guess what will happen, the music was so bad, with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall avoid this crappy movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save some money.&#34;
b&#39;Jack-O (1995) was a really bad movie, we are talking snoozefest x 100, no entertainment value whatsoever, no budget, no gore, Z-grade actors etc etc, this film was an awful addition to the horror movie industry and shouldn\&#39;t have been made!!! The only reason i purchased this movie was because i knew Linnea Quigley was in it, and sure enough, she does her obligatory nude shower scene, which is lovely yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as for the film itself........ i fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and had NO desire at all to finish it, it\&#39;s just bigtime lame OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love horror movies, i\&#39;m an avid fan, a MASSIVE fan, i love low budget horrors, i love it all, but i hated this rubbish, so i think that will tell you all you need to know about &#34;JACK-O&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this movie 2/10, the &#34;2&#34; is for the 2 minute Linnea shower scene, the movie itself is a total ZERO!!!!&#39;
b&#39;From Kreestos: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialog is terrible, awful, drivel. Acting poor. Many plot flaws. I don\&#39;t recommend this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artistic licenses The working manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [1], both of whom were male, not female as depicted in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The copyists neither contributed to nor altered the score. In fact, they were berated by Beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is set in 1824 during the composition of Beethoven\&#39;s Ninth Symphony. Throughout the movie Beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. In reality, Beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The Ninth Symphony was composed at a time when Beethoven\&#39;s hearing had deteriorated severely. At this point in his life, most of Beethoven\&#39;s conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks. It can be argued, however, that he was also able to read people\&#39;s lips, evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the film, Beethoven makes an allusion to the Moonlight Sonata. This is an anachronism as the Sonata No. 14 &#34;quasi una fantasia&#34; was not named &#34;Moonlight&#34; until several years after his death.&#39;
b&#34;I don&#39;t usually like TV movies, I reckon that if the thing was any good it would make it to Hollywood. This one though is better than average, pretty high production values, a few interesting story twists and some nice shots of NYC (along with Toronto) hold the interest.&#34;
b&#34;Being a HUGE fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film.I was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller-coaster ride......alas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to start on this mess?i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny.I was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing.Many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the &#39;terrible&#39; guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to run,but to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting,at times,is pathetic.Fenella Fielding is wasted as the loony Mrs Foxfur and i&#39;ve seen Simon Pegg have much better outings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d recommend Guest House Paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more.But to any bottom fan who hasn&#39;t seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned&#34;
b&#34;this film is basically a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children, she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house. when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little kid could have written it. not much suspense, it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film. at the beginning, when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. whats up with that? the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a Beatles concert. even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy. don&#39;t waste your time with this. nuff said&#34;
b&#34;This movie, although well shot and superbly acted, was awful. I felt as if I was watching a car accident--sure I kept watching but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. Although, it did fit the tone of the movie, I was hoping for something to improve this movie. I still don&#39;t understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie. Fifteen minutes of plot that really didn&#39;t do much. It&#39;s really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful, awful, story. There&#39;s not much more to say about this movie. Save yourself the time and watch c-span. It&#39;ll be more uplifting.&#34;
b&#34;Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don&#39;t be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. The kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I didn&#39;t like him as the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the realm of children&#39;s films ever again. His portrayal of The Cat is a slightly toned down version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cat in the Hat may be the worst kids movie ever.&#34;
b&#39;This was an 1970s-type irreverent comedy, poking fun at the psychiatric profession and at Beverly Hills. I didn\&#39;t mind that but I did object to more that irreverence regarding marriage and religion: two topics which secular filmmakers (meaning about everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere) just can\&#39;t stop trashing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walter Matthau plays a scuzzy character, &#34;Donald Becker,&#34; who walks around with a cleric\&#39;s collar on, which offends me but when has Hollywood ever been worried about offending Christians?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, despite that nonsense the film has its entertaining moments and even some charm to it. Dan Aykroyd is good at paying a nut-case and Donna Dixon (&#34;Laura Rollins&#34;) is a knockout. I am sorry she didn\&#39;t have a bigger role.&#39;
b&#34;Not only have I read the book and watched the movie, but I was stationed on the USS John F Kennedy when they filmed this. Needless to say, Film crews and actors can be trying to people trying to do their jobs. Now, about the movie. As a career Navy man, I was pretty upset on how they showed life on board an Aircraft Carrier. I could pick apart the inaccuracies throughout the movie (anyone that has lived on a carrier could), but that would take pages. One scene that stands out in particular was when they were in the CIC (Combat Information Center) and they were watching a RADAR contact move across the screen. Each time the contact moved, it beeped. Unfortunately, that equipment doesn&#39;t beep like that (I was a technician on that equipment). The book was based upon fact, the movie wasn&#39;t. The follow on TV series was just as bad and the Navy finally realized that support for this series would just make them look bad. If you&#39;re a Navy person, watch this to see how a movie about carrier life is seen from the eyes of Hollywood. If your not a Navy person, watch Midway or Top Gun, at least those movies are entertaining and based upon fact.&#34;
b&#39;I saw this film in the movie theater. I was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. It is a Woodward film about one of Second City\&#39;s Native sons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knew about Johns history. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie. Well. Forget the idea of poor Michael Chilklis (who is a really great actor) being in a really astonishingly bad film, and really only relegated to doing an impersonation of the man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of Belushi\&#39;s work...and all the SNL scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow Bob Woodwards work. Kinda saying &#34;Okay...we are about to mess with Belushi...now lets go after Woodward too...&#34; They also decided to take the premise of It\&#39;s a Wonderful Life and turn it into It\&#39;s a Horrible Life on Crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is he a guardian angel or the devil? Is the pinball machine the devil\&#39;s assistant electronic device...how many different endings can you tack onto to a movie? It is one of those movies after it is over...you look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go &#34;What the hell was that?!&#34; In some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic. But for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of (or throw out snappy one liners) to the screen. A cult film is never good. And most people would never watch them in any serious context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to watch some classic bad late 80\&#39;s fair stoned? Rent Wired. If you want to know about John Belushi...you can get more information off of the walls of Second City Chicago than this movie.&#39;
b&#34;Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1 out of 10: In Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity time is of the perspective of the one that views time. (Or so I&#39;ve heard) In other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change. Even on fast-forward (And you will be reaching for that fast forward button) it clocks in somewhere around eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are familiar with Lionsgate&#39;s own version of Project Greenlight (This is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local Wal-Mart) you will not be surprised by the complete and utter lack of entertainment value contained within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line reading (I refuse to call it acting) is uniformly awful. This is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between cans of Schlitz. The camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast augmentation scars in the nude scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is awful, the sets are from a haunted Halloween put on by ADHD middle school students and once again the line reading (remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming) is distracting beyond mere words. Avoid.&#34;
b&#39;Well, &#34;built&#34; Doris Day (as Ethel S. &#34;Dynamite&#34; Jackson) is mistaken for thespian Ethel Barrymore, and falls in love with dancer Ray Bolger (as S. &#34;Sam&#34; Winthrop Putnam). Older Frenchman Claude Dauphin (as Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. Honestly\xc2\x85 What were they thinking? - This wildly inappropriate musical does feature Ms. Day prettily singing the standard &#34;April in Paris&#34;, and others. Certainly, there nothing as good as her Columbia recordings from the time; and, nothing approaches Day\&#39;s stunning and forthcoming &#34;Secret Love&#34;. Although the material does not serve him well, it\&#39;s nice to see Mr. Bolger performing. Some of the musical numbers are obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** April in Paris (12/24/52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin&#39;
b&#39;It\&#39;s the one film I almost walked out of, and would have if my friends hadn\&#39;t been in the movie theatre with me. Normally, even if I don\&#39;t like a film, I think it\&#39;s still worth sitting through it to the end. That way, you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself. But with The Million Dollar Hotel, it was so dreadful I just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible. I think I probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director, one I didn\&#39;t normally like so much. But coming from Wenders, it was all the more shocking to behold. I know Bono from U2, a good friend of Wenders\&#39;s, wrote the script to this abysmal film, and I wonder why Wenders let him, as buddy-buddy as the two may have been. &#34;Stick to the day job, Bono&#34;, is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess. Pretentious, disjointed, a mish-mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype, a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring, with the most irritating characters I have ever set eyes upon, especially the leads, Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson, none of whom I dislike normally. The happiest ending I could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible. On a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, with an extremely stirring soundtrack from U2. But the film\&#39;s opening shots make the rest of the film (which takes a spectacular nose-dive from then on) all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that\&#39;s just never delivered, not even close.&#39;
b&#34;I understand that this was Llyod Kaufman&#39;s attempt to save a movie that was the pits. The whole movie is voiced over since the audio reel was junk. The voice overs were SO bad and terrible quality. As much as I love Troma, they tend to be a little heavy on the voice over work. The acting was terrible. One thing I did enjoy from this movie was the quick cameo of Trey Parker doing the aristocrats joke with a goofy wig on. There are a lot of big director dudes in this movie like James Gunn and Eli Roth (friends of Lloyd Kaufman). Again I think this was Llyods attempt of saving a crappy movie and trying not to lose 1000s of dollars. I won&#39;t go on and on but this movie was a mess. Check out other Troma titles.&#34;
b&#39;This is one of the worst movies EVER made. I can\&#39;t believe how bad it was. I was shocked at the awfulness of the &#34;ghoulies&#34; masks. They are OBVIOUSLY Halloween masks! The mouths don\&#39;t even move when they talk!!!!! Why did they feel the need to make the ghoulies comical and goofy? Whenever they do anything there seems to be this circus-like music and overused BONK and BOING noises when they hit people. The bondage dominatrix lady is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. This movie is just bad. The plot is nonexistent. The mom from ONE TREE HILL is in this though and she has obviously had a nose job since this was made. Why did the main character from the first movie return to make this garbage? BAD BAD BAD movie.&#39;
b&#34;I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan&#39;s role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma&#39;s direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;m not going to bother mentioning any of the plot - this is strictly a B movie on its way to obscurity. The shock to me, though, is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film. Erika Eleniak, never anything you\&#39;d call a thespian anyway, seems to have morphed into Anna Nicole Smith (in her Big period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. He\&#39;s always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess, as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies but, if you like martial arts, eminently watchable). Here, he is a shell of his former self - sure, he\&#39;s older, but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested ... I just don\&#39;t get it. Don\&#39;t these people invest? William Forsythe is another &#34;heavy&#34; that I\&#39;ve always liked, but his last several roles are what you would call &#34;mailing it in&#34;. I\&#39;m not going to even mention Mr. Reynolds - his gig here amounts to a throwaway, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usual a creepy, evil, pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk - the best kind! This is a movie you watch for laughs. There\&#39;s nothing else to it.&#39;
b&#39;The Disney studios\&#39; remake of their own 1965 slapstick classic concerns a clever feline leading an F.B.I. agent to a kidnapped woman. Christina Ricci gives a churlish, let-me-outta-here performance as the cat\&#39;s owner and the fed is played by Doug E. Doug, embarrassingly over-the-top, like a human cartoon. A pair of rich neurotics (Dyan Cannon and original &#34;Cat&#34; cast member Dean Jones) are funny and the formula-plot still has a little juice left in it, but the handling here is so heavy and lugubrious, and the cat is so lifeless, that it\&#39;s strictly D.O.A. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* from ****&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;m not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established. However, watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a Shelley Hack reference while on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. We can only assume he had a Charlie\&#39;s Angels fixation at one time. Based on that reference, we assumed this film must have been made around her Charlie\&#39;s Angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what I\&#39;ve read here it was made around 1987. You sure couldn\&#39;t tell that from the poor production values. It seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class. And while by no means would I expect a low-budget trash fest like this to be politically correct, the rednecks in this film sure did like to direct derogatory gay remarks to each other. Even so I\&#39;d still only rank this as the 2nd worst horror film ever made, second only to &#34;Nail Gun Massacre.&#34;&#39;
b&#34;What a terrible sequel. The reason I give this film two stars instead of zero because it&#39;s a movie that has violence and gore and critters, yet it is planned out poorly. And this god-awful sequel was done by none other than BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM!!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The bonehead that brought you the remake of The Shining which nearly got Kubrick to nearly roll in his grave when he discovered it was actually made. Garris is also the man that brought you the sad sequel of THE FLY, THE FLY, which was a wonderful movie, but Garris&#39;s movie nearly ruined John Getz career. Anyway, if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in order, don&#39;t. That&#39;s the mistake I made, rent the first one or the third one or better yet DON&#39;T STOOP TO THAT LEVEL AT ALL! This movie sucked so bad that I can&#39;t believe it, please avoid this crap. Shame on you, Mick!&#34;
b&#39;Possibly one of the best, most horrible b movies ever, as in it\&#39;s so bad and random,it\&#39;s kinda hilarious and i don\&#39;t know how to feel about it..reminds me of Cabin Fever..there\&#39;s just something about that kid jumping off the porch doing karate and yelling \&#39;pancakes\&#39; that\&#39;s intriguing. Since a lot of people have already outlined the plot and everything all i\&#39;m going to do is sum up the quality of the movie with one quote: &#34;I\&#39;m the park ranger who\&#39;s going to f*ck you up&#34;. yeah, enough said?. If you\&#39;re looking for quality or a really scary movie, i don\&#39;t recommend it. but if you like these sorts of films then I guess you would enjoy it..I don\&#39;t know how, but I guess some people would.&#39;
b&#34;Due to rather dubious plate tectonics, Japan starts to slip under the sea. Initial predictions say it&#39;ll take about 40 years before the country is submerged, but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than 1 year! The government think he&#39;s a crackpot, but evidence soon starts bearing his theory out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of Hollywood films of the late 90&#39;s (I assume, having seen none of them), with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human (well, Japanese) spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice, and proving the power of love or something like that. i.e. it&#39;s as naive in its psychology as it&#39;s geology... we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned, and the other half would just panic and be useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film does have some very nice special effects, but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent Hollywood production would be. It is at least as nationalistic, humourless and lacking in self-awareness as that Hollywood film would be though, and probably has even worse acting. It does have the hot evil chick from Battle Royale as one of the leads... but she&#39;s not even slightly evil, and is therefore much less hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is much too long at 132 minutes, and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking. I certainly didn&#39;t care in the slightest whether Japan sank or not by the half way point, and well before the end I was trying to think of ways to expedite the process should I ever find myself in that situation for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it does have nice special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still pretty hot, so I magnanimously give it... 3/10.&#34;
b&#39;There are certain horror directors for whom I\&#39;ve built up so much respect &amp; admiration over the years, that they can\&#39;t possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film. Lucio Fulci is surely one of them, but damned, he\&#39;s trying to disappoint me with his later efforts! You can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films Fulci directed or produced during the late 80\&#39;s and simply watch &#34;Cat in the Brain&#34; instead, because that one title gathers and repeats the best and absolute goriest footage of no less than SEVEN other Fulci-flicks, including the sickest murders sequences featuring in &#34;When Alice Broke the Mirror&#34;. As a whole, this movie definitely ranks among our director\&#39;s weakest and most pointless achievements. The script is incoherent as hell, the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there\&#39;s absolutely no suspense to enjoy. I love the title, but it\&#39;s actually quite meaningless. There is a character named Alice in the story, but it\&#39;s only a supportive role and she certainly doesn\&#39;t break any mirrors. I suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice, as she\&#39;s an opera singer, but she doesn\&#39;t. The plot revolves on a middle-aged and gambling-addicted playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson butchers the ladies (as well as unwelcome witnesses) in gruesome ways, makes steaks out of their juiciest body parts and feeds the remainders to his cat. There\&#39;s also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. The difference between &#34;When Alice Broke the Mirror&#34; and some of Fulci\&#39;s greatest horror films (&#34;The Beyond&#34;, &#34;City of the Living Dead&#34;, \xc2\x85&#34;) lies in the fact that he totally doesn\&#39;t bother to create a horrific atmosphere. The characters, Lester included, are colorless and boring and the murders are ordinarily depicted; like it\&#39;s the most common thing in the world to put a woman\&#39;s head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car. The lighting is poor, the cinematography super-ugly, the editing clumsy and amateurish and the acting performances are downright miserable. If I didn\&#39;t know any better, I would think Lucio deliberately made a lousy film in order to protest against all the harsh critics that dislike his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it. The obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore &amp; bloodshed, because even the attempt to blend in black comedy doesn\&#39;t work properly. As long as Lester swings around his chainsaw and cuts off women\&#39;s feet, &#34;When Alice Broke the Mirror&#34; is an undemanding piece of horror entertainment, but other than that, there\&#39;s isn\&#39;t a whole lot to recommend.&#39;
b&#39;this movie has NO plot. it was SUPPOSED to be that a guy moves in with his grandma, and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he\&#39;s living with? they have a big pot party at grandma\&#39;s house. the climax of the movie didn\&#39;t even relate to the rest of it. that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie\&#39;s end. i can see how it COULD have related to the supposed story - that Grandma\&#39;s VG skills redeem him - but that just wasn\&#39;t there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Her pussy smells like the great depression&#34; &#34;He just sucked his first titty...yeah for 13 hours&#34; &#34;It\&#39;s for you...i think it\&#39;s the Devil&#34;&#39;
b&#34;A whole bunch of teenagers gather around to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest has showed up and is killing everybody off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the worst horror film of the 90&#39;s, Camp Blood (1999) is the only film that could challenge it for that title, has some of the dumbest characters and situations to ever grace a television screen. The so called surprise ending is awful, as is the rest of this film. Mildly entertaining on a sooo bad it is good level. My rating: 2 out of 10.&#34;
b&#34;Early Jackie Chan film where there is no sign of the Chan persona we know. This is Chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios all through Hong Kong Taiwan and Mainland China. Its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult Jackie Chan to super stardom. Its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short. As a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie. I was watching it, in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that I watched that day had I not noticed Jackie in the film. Honestly I don&#39;t think the film is really worth bothering with (there are too many other better variations) except if you&#39;re interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started.&#34;
b&#34;I saw this movie today on the big screen and i can honestly not believe some of the comments made by people on here. I was really hoping to be touched by this film, but wasn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m ex Australian Army and very patriotic towards this great country, but I feel this movie no way does justice for us and those soldier who fought at this battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is poorly filmed. I thought the acting was terrible, they were not believable and they didn&#39;t give me any reason for me to care about them. People are saying this movie was graphic, there were a couple of graphic scenes but I found most part very weak. The war scenes were very short and only last a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a weak film that doesn&#39;t do these soldiers any justice.&#34;
b&#39;This film revival right march in a bad film industry and Saudi Arabia, I want to know how the director was able to stand in front of people of the industry after he making this film, work was so very bad, we do not know how cinema Saudi companies such as Rutana and other does not support yang Filmmakers in KSA like UAE We hope in the future to prosper film industry in Saudi Arabia But without such intervention Fools traders and idiots make us bad movies do not benefit the reputation of cinema in Saudi Arabia is like the Roman and Iranian cinema At the same time, please makers simple experimental cinema in Saudi Arabia such as Abdullah alayaf And others to achieve the dream of a good film industry to participate in festivals world away from the major companies interventions stupid&#39;
b&#39;This movie is overrated, to say the least. It\&#39;s not good as a comedy, and it\&#39;s not good as a &#34;serious&#34; film either. The pacing is far too plodding for the former, and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter. The only laughs come from some of Bud Spencer\&#39;s reaction shots when he becomes exasperated by his brother\&#39;s behavior. The dubbing is excellent but the full-screen framing is appalling. (*1/2)&#39;
b&#39;Shame to see an interesting story diluted into standard &#34;Vietnam made for TV&#34; fare. Usually HBO movies are a substantial cut above TV. Bill Paxton was a pretty good choice for the lead role, but wasn\&#39;t given much to work with.&#39;
b&#34;I really didn&#39;t like this film~!!!! it was boring and didn&#39;t interest me that much at all.. i&#39;m more of an action girl, and it had NONE. i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left.. but was totally mislead! don&#39;t get this movie unless you like the dessert and plenty of boredom. i just really didn&#39;t like the movie. it wasn&#39;t my style, but it could be yours.. you would just have to watch the previews or something but it&#39;s my recommendation if you&#39;re a girl.. don&#39;t get this movie! This Scandinavian production draws on some of the observational strategies of Godfrey Reggio&#39;s Koyaanisqatsi, allowing us to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping viewpoints. this just isn&#39;t for me!&#34;
b&#39;I made it about 8 minutes into &#34;Steel Frontier&#34; before I turned it off. Then, glutton for punishment that I am, I watched some more the next day. Today I had to iron a pile of clothes, so I decided to finish the movie, and that was its own punishment. Here\&#39;s what I don\&#39;t understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $7,000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies. Yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money, and they churn out a huge, steaming pile of crap. Let me see if I can figure out the logic: &#34;It\&#39;s \&#39;Road Warrior\&#39; but it\&#39;s like a future Western. We\&#39;ll get the cheapest \&#39;actors\&#39; we can find, we\&#39;ll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script, and we\&#39;ll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions. We can\&#39;t lose!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. I don\&#39;t think even the MST3K guys could improve this. But if you insist on watching it, I recommend getting very drunk first.&#39;
b&#39;Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive and prolific directors of all time, because he is arguably all of these things. It takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties. Saboteur, however, is not creative or prolific at all. Rather, Hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster &#34;American Pride,&#34; a certain call-to-arms, support-our-troops title which was a popular theme of the time. With that in mind, Hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film, including but not limited to a logical plot, characterization, believable dialog, and a fluent, running storyline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically Hitchcock does great with espionage films, only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but seemingly lost his stride in creating Saboteur and merely recycled the same once-thrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided. Without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across America, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. At the dinner party, Kane and Patricia don\&#39;t want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were &#34;gate crashers.&#34; Logically, what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening? Besides, does anyone need to be reminded Kane is a wanted terrorist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Nobody recognizes him...his face is on EVERY NEWSPAPER!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The spies catch up with Kane in the ghost town and assume he\&#39;s the man Freeman sent to work with them...shouldn\&#39;t\&#39;t he have some sort of credentials? I know spies don\&#39;t run around with name tags and photo IDs but a secret handshake maybe? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Cop picks up Kane escaping from Freeman\&#39;s house, still seems no one recognizes this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. How exactly does the FBI come to believe Kane with no evidence? They don\&#39;t even show Kane talking to the FBI, the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. When the cops search the Carnival Caravan how do they know Kane is now with a woman? The blind man believed Kane\&#39;s story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing, kidnapped, or even more importantly running with Kane. Why does this movie not employ logic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a running list. The movie is not exciting, the plot makes no sense, and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing. Hitchcock fails miserably on this one.&#39;
b&#39;I have recently become a huge fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he\&#39;s the most deliciously original comedian to come along in ages. He is refreshing and fearless in his routines, which run the gamut of topics from how much Bush sucks to the sleazy exploits of 1970s producer Robert Evans. I\&#39;m a longtime fan of Maria Bamford and her wide-eyed innocent/schizophrenic routine. Whenever she effortlessly switches her naturally high-pitched voice to one that is clipped and throaty, I can\&#39;t help but giggle. I liked Brian Posehn long before I even knew he was on &#34;Just Shoot Me&#34;, and there is something so innately funny about his aging nerd persona. All three of these talented, unique comedians headline &#34;The Comedians of Comedy&#34;, a Netflix documentary about their U.S. tour. They truly deserve to be stars, and this tour gave them the recognition they so richly deserve. I thought,no, I KNEW I\&#39;d like this movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was wrong. Instead of the three comics each getting their own routine segments, &#34;The Comedians of Comedy&#34; is bogged down by meandering and dull documentary scenes that contain no humor, no insight, nothing of real interest. I think there is a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines total in the 109 minute movie. What a rip-off! Come on, is anyone really interested in seeing our stars banter in their RV? Where\&#39;s the humor in seeing Posehn in an arcade and a comic book shop? Does anyone find random diner scenes particularly funny? If this movie couldn\&#39;t have shown our comics strutting their stuff, at least make it about what life is like on the road. It\&#39;s not even about that. Worst of all, the comics never appear to be having real fun. Oswalt admits how bored he is doing a radio interview, Posehn sheepishly admits to how much he sucks at giving a tour of his home, and Bamford nervously improvises every time the camera is pointed at her, and her humor there is only sporadic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheesh, these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional, amazingly crafted humor that is a refreshing change of pace from the brainless entertainment of mainstream comics like Dane Cook. Instead, we have to sit through their mundane, everyday routines on the road in a substandard bore of a movie whose quality could easily be surpassed by any student film. If you can locate any of Oswalt\&#39;s, Posehn\&#39;s, or Bamford\&#39;s performances on DVD, by all means do. Their talent should be a joy to behold, not a chore like it is here.&#39;
b&#34;First there was Tsui Hark&#39;s Zu Warriors (2001), which is visually ground-breaking, but much lacking in the acting and writing departments, now this movie, which is visually almost as good as Zu (though no longer ground-breaking), but is even worse in the acting and writing departments. It&#39;s really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the HK movie industry. I guess you need to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are. It&#39;s like some delinquent kids talking in the street, it&#39;s that bad. To make it worse, the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids, and can&#39;t act even if their life depend on it. I understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in HK, but has HK youths really become so brain-dead that they can&#39;t appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar acting/writing? If that&#39;s the case, it makes me ashamed to be from HK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish HK movie makers will learn some lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee, and finally make a movie that&#39;s both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments. And stop using young singers/idols/heartthrobs as actors because they can&#39;t act however many fans they may have in HK!&#34;
b&#39;Robert Lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter, but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four-dimensional! Atomic-age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way. Perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time (with psychological overtones), yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive; it\&#39;s a camp-fest tailor-made for TV\&#39;s late-late show. Wooden performances by Lansing and Lee Meriwether barely rate as one-dimensional, though Patty Duke (playing a cute brat pre-&#34;Miracle Worker&#34;) gets a colorful, memorable exit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** from ****&#39;
b&#39;***SPOILERS!*** I sometimes wonder what makes sequel-makers think that they have to explain (and therefore destroy) the mysteries behind iconic Horror films. The original &#34;Hellraiser&#34; of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. The 1988 sequel &#34;Hellbound&#34; was also a fantastic Horror film, though I personally didn\&#39;t like how the viewer got background information on the Cenobites, some of the all-time creepiest Horror-villains in the original. The third part, &#34;Hell on Earth&#34; (1992) was already quite a mess, whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy lead-cenobite Pinhead (a typical 90s stupidity) and therefore destroyed most of his scariness. This fourth part &#34;Hellraiser: Bloodline&#34; (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third one, but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary \&#39;background information\&#39; about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made? I think not, and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film. The setting of &#34;Bloodline&#34; goes back and forth in three different periods. The film begins in a 22nd century space-station, when scientist Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) attempts to close the gates to hell forever. When government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons. In 18th century Paris, Merchant\&#39;s ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult. An evoked demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it, the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages... The film, which takes place in the 18th century, the present, and the 22nd century, really is quite a mess. I admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but its also its smallest part. The parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak, and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. The film\&#39;s undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make-up and gore-effects, the absolutely ravishing Valentina Varagas as the she-demon, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, in spite of having lost some of his creepiness, still is a menacing villain. It is an almost offensive idea for &#34;Hellraiser&#34; fans, however, that Pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light-show. Overall, &#34;Bloodline&#34; is not a complete disaster, but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly. Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed about it, as he preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee. Overall, this is only recommendable to hardcore Pinhead-fanatics, and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon\&#39;s creepiness. All others are well-advised to stick with the brilliant first, and excellent second part of the &#34;Hellraiser&#34; franchise and skip all the others. The makeup effects in &#34;Bloodline&#34; are creepy as hell, but almost everything else is disappointing. My rating: 3.5/10&#39;
b&#39;Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Make-up FX artists that help create the &#34;beast&#34; for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original make-up for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and re-shoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the re-done creature was no where near as awesome as the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it was quite sad because this was Jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad re-shoots. Anyway, I thought you guys may find that a tad interesing, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some &#34;behind the scenes&#34; photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, Jeff&#39;
b&#34;First of all, I&#39;d like to say I am a teenager so this is all marketed towards me, and I can safely say that iCarly very poor programing, and the fact that it&#39;s accepted among both genders baffles me. It contains some of the worst attempts at comedy I&#39;ve ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot. The supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someone&#39;s lines again with poor sarcasm, poor sarcasm, saying bad one-liners, and, well, you get the picture. Also, I should mention that I do still watch Spongebob, which I know I&#39;ll get a negative backlash for, but that&#39;s quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it, less we forget something iCarly&#39;s missing; WIT. The show&#39;s about a young girl, Carly, putting on a web-show with her friends, which I can say is without a doubt a nicer version of the internet. That&#39;s fine, but the show&#39;s just...well, not funny at all, as previously stated. If this is what children&#39;s programming has come to today, parents, show them something that&#39;s ACTUALLY funny; Spongebob or Rocco&#39;s Modern Life would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, compared to it&#39;s brothering show, Drake &amp; Josh, it&#39;s terrible, which was implied. Seriously, please watch something worthwhile. Even for a children&#39;s show it&#39;s poor.&#34;
b&#39;Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! This is a horror movie, not thriller, not suspense, a horror movie. Yes, this movie is a horror. Horrifyingly bad. After many years of lurking here at IMDb, I am actually moved to set up an account just so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! IT WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I\&#39;d love to hear the director\&#39;s voice over on an &#34;enhanced&#34; DVD (there\&#39;s another horrifying thought) to see what the hell they were thinking. The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand, which provided no subtitles to the Russian dialog. Not that it mattered much. Straining to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give this movie a &#34;1&#34; because I cannot give it a lower rating, and because it did achieve one remarkable thing. It somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie NOT feel claustrophobic. Now that\&#39;s a dubious achievement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERE\&#39;S YOUR SPOILER: And the ending, holy mother (no pun intended) it\&#39;s like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming. The &#34;climax&#34; of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen on film. Exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this - the off button.&#39;
b&#34;It may be, although there are still two or three I&#39;ve missed. This film constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape, reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from Sherlock Holmes movies, and populates it with sinister, Kafka-esque characters. Into their midst, the movie drops Mia Farrow, who sounds like she&#39;s still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reprising his nebbish role from Play It Again Sam. Are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and hand-wringing? I suppose I would, if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy, but it&#39;s not. At least I don&#39;t think it is.&#34;
b&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to like some of the Hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s. They had icons such as Arnie and Sly but I think the action movie in the &#39;90s has plummeted to new depths. The worst of these, I believe, was Armageddon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is shamelessly contrived and pulls off the worst cliches as it seeks to excite viewers. The melodrama is so cringingly saccharine and awful that you actually cannot wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, regrettably decided to jump onto the commercial bandwagon. This movie symbolises the new Hollywood aesthetic of grand special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. That is the norm these days and I begin to wonder if there is a role in Hollywood for screenwriters. It seems as though they just employ hacks and committees to write the facile scripts. The rest they leave to technology. There is not a single piece of grand, heartfelt human emotion in Armageddon. It just feels empty and bland. I can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves Liv Tyler&#39;s dad who doesn&#39;t even make an appearance in the film. Steven Tyler&#39;s band Aerosmith provide a theme song for the movie - a ballad that really soars and at least tugs at the heartstrings a little when the end credits come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I weep for Western civilization if people like this predictable, cumbersome movie. It stands for shallowness, lethargy, and a decline in the human intellect. I would even prefer to watch the eighth Friday the 13th.&#34;
b&#39;First Off, I am a huge fan of Robert Blake, always have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie came on Movieplex last night 10/13, and the title interested me &amp; of course the star. But after watching it I was left more confused than I was before it started.... There are some good scenes, and I thought they would lead somewhere, but they didn\&#39;t, it turned out to be an &#34;anti-cop&#34; &#34;anti-buddy&#34; &#34;anti-hippie&#34;, pretty much &#34;anti-everything movie&#34;, with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Blake is great as the lead, well as great as someone could be with this bad movie, I am still a huge fan of Mr. Blake and love his acting even in crap like this...But this drug induced 70\&#39;s tripe, well... better stay away from this one...And, that ending, what a pisser.&#39;
b&#34;This movie is very much like every other modern horror movie. It&#39;s predictable in the way it gets build up and progresses and just never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking to the screen. That&#39;s really the biggest disappointment of the movie, that overall still had a promising main concept for a movie of its sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can call this movie a big walking modern horror movie clich\xc3\xa9. It has all of the elements in it that make modern horror movies often not so very great ones to watch. One of these aspects is a moaning and very naive little kid. Why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies? Same goes for the sort of drama aspects, that involves the family. It just doesn&#39;t work out for the movie and is far from interesting or effective. It often instead causes the movie to drag in parts and become an annoying one to watch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it has all of the clich\xc3\xa9s present but it also doesn&#39;t succeed at bringing any of these clich\xc3\xa9s well to the screen. As an horror movie this simply is a very poor one. It doesn&#39;t handle its horror or tension very well. For the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. The movie its story isn&#39;t too well connected and build up within the movie. Too often the movie sleeps in at parts and it doesn&#39;t ever allow its horror to fully kick in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is also often way too dark (no doubt as an attempt to hide its fairly low budget) and it shows very little gore as well, mostly due to the fact that you simply can not always see things so very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can just tell by looking at this movie that director J.S. Cardone doesn&#39;t has much talent for the genre and doesn&#39;t know how to handle its present ingredients properly. He did some attempts in the past but all of his movies have failed so far. he just keeps trying unfortunately. Who knows, perhaps with the right people behind the camera&#39;s (like Tobe Hooper, who was initially attached to direct) this movie still could had been something decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a poorly cast movie, with mostly big unknowns in it. Biggest name of the movie is Ben Cross but his role is just way too small and in a way also not really relevant enough for the movie and its story. It didn&#39;t even seemed like he had much fun playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#34;
b&#39;How could they take such a beautifully animated gem like Don Bluth\&#39;s All Dogs go to Heaven and bastardize it with a charmless, cheesy, uninspired sequel. The haunting music and delightful characters are gone, now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: Charlie Sheen is sometimes fun as Charlie, but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by Burt Reynolds. I did particularly enjoy the songs &#34;I will always be with you&#34; and &#34;It\&#39;s too Heavenly here&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: There seems to be no connection between this and the original. In the beginning Charlie is chums with Carface, but wait a minute. Isn\&#39;t this the same character who was responsible for Charlie\&#39;s murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? I guess that all changes in Heaven but why isn\&#39;t Anne-Marie even mentioned? If Itchy makes it to Heaven, wouldn\&#39;t Flo and Killer make it too? What is with Annabelle the whippet\&#39;s voice? In the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny, bitchy, parrot. The new characters aren\&#39;t all that great (except Sasha). And the animation is better compared to a generic Saturday morning cartoon. The constant cartoony &#34;humor&#34; is flat and unfunny and the &#34;heart&#34; just doesn\&#39;t work when compare to the original, which had such a moving unsubtle touch that makes me cry every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Dogs go to Heaven is one of my all-time favorite films. How Don Bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Not all sequels go to Heaven.&#39;
b&#34;Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy alongside clich\xc3\xa9-ridden moralizing. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his wicked buddy. Laughable special effects. Overdone acting with bad timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the Flood? Strange twists and too many sub-plots the Bible doesn&#39;t mention. God as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B-movie wannabee director John Irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly-directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction.&#34;
b&#39;Jerry Lewis was marginally funny when he didn\&#39;t write his own material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he started writing and directing his own films what little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania. Whenever his films would fail (and deservedly so) in the American market (they made money in France) Lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself; for example, he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that it was, according to Lewis, released on a double-bill with the porno feature &#34;Deep Throat&#34;. If anyone should have complained about that situation, it should have been the producers of &#34;Deep Throat.&#34; This is an absolutely idiotic &#34;comedy&#34; about the world\&#39;s richest man (Lewis) who is rejected for military service during WW2 and decides to outfit a special &#34;squad&#34; to go to Germany and capture Hitler himself. Besides the many faults this film has (the script is mind-numbingly unfunny, Lewis\&#39; &#34;direction&#34; is nonexistent, the film has the look of a cheap home movie), Lewis apparently thought that surrounding himself with no-talent, over-the-hill Borscht Belt comics like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller was a good idea; he must have figured that they would be so bad, they would make him look good. He was half-right; they are embarrassingly bad, but he comes out even worse than they do. For a &#34;comedy&#34;, Lewis\&#39; character is sullen, angry and pushy; the way he heaps abuse on his underlings makes you wonder why they would ever follow a bullying jerk like this on a dangerous mission like trying to capture Hitler. The fact that this movie took in any money at all is astounding. It is by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I have ever seen--I\&#39;ve heard that &#34;Slapstick&#34; is even more pathetic, but I can\&#39;t bring myself to see if that\&#39;s true or not--and is to be avoided at all possible costs.&#39;
b&#39;This is definitely a &#34;lesser known&#34; comedy short from the 1920s. The only reason I saw it was because it was on a DVD by Kino Films featuring non-Laurel and Hardy shorts featuring Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but also generally average to below average for the style film. Compared to shorts by Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor. Also, the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent DVDs. I ended up turning OFF the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to set the proper mood. But, despite this, they are still worth seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve gotta be honest about this short. It was the last of 8 on this DVD and by the time I got to it, I was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts. So, it is possible the film might be A LITTLE better than a 4--but certainly, if this is the case, no better than a 5! The film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy. Nothing especially interesting and there are certainly MUCH better silent shorts out there.&#39;
b&#39;I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me, but I think I have an idea: one of the &#34;Fat Guys At the Movies.&#34; The person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (I\&#39;m paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if I misquoted.) At any rate, I made the decision to watch it. So I take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I\&#39;ve ever seen. Strange, I doubt I\&#39;ve ever called a movie &#34;stupid&#34; but that was the first word that came to mind about one-third in and stayed in my mind until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to begin? Unbelievable premise and reactions, incredibly brain-dead characters (could blame the writing or the actors, or I\&#39;ll just blame both) and enormously bad acting. I\&#39;d sooner believe Bill Pullman as President of the USA than a FBI agent here. (Of course, there\&#39;s a reason for that, and I\&#39;ll partially go into that.) And to top it off, if you can\&#39;t figure the so-called shocking &#34;twist&#34; in the first 5 minutes, then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late. Don\&#39;t worry, they\&#39;ll tell you the &#34;twist&#34; every five minutes thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s been some serial killer(s) on the loose in the most depressing town in the county, or world. But there\&#39;s more to the story! Some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement. Could there possibly be more? Oh, yeah, there\&#39;s a family, well maybe not, but there are four humans, one boy, one girl and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction than Cole sees dead people in The Sixth Sense. There\&#39;s gotta be more to this than what I mentioned! That\&#39;s what makes a movie interesting! Adding as many subplots that may/may not be developed is the way to go! Okay, then I\&#39;ll continue. We have goofy FBI agents that made me laugh. A pair of giggling druggies who\&#39;s shocked at first their dealer OD\&#39;s but then resorts to robbery. A gosh-tooting great-guy cop who must\&#39;ve been put in for comic relief who\&#39;s always battling an angry/suspicious cop. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside who didn\&#39;t just phone his performance in, he barely text it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these work. They\&#39;re all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks, and believe me, you\&#39;ll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin. In addition, the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all. I guess I\&#39;m referring mostly to the cops, but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It\&#39;s barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was, unless his exposure has been limited to Goosebumps stories. And what\&#39;s with the title? Surveillance? Oh, I get it; it\&#39;s because it was used in 1/50 subplots just to film interviews. Since that\&#39;s so random, it might as well been called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this horrid mess.&#39;
b&#39;i found this movie to be mostly a P.O.S.it was low budget,but that isn\&#39;t the problem.the problem is,the movie is just lame.it doesn\&#39;t really make a lot of sense.yes,it does explain why things happened,but that\&#39;s not what i mean.there was just no reason for it all.the movie also moved very slow.the last ice age was quicker than this.also, i think they went overboard a bit in the kills.i don\&#39;t mean they were too gross,but the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the head,or stabbing his victim. maybe i\&#39;m being petty,but i just didn\&#39;t like the movie.the whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of &#34;When a Stranger Calls&#34; and maybe that was the whole point.but so what.for me &#34;When A Stranger Kills&#34; is a 4/10*&#39;
b&#39;Last fall (of 2001), I took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to dissect any scene of a film, and his winning of an Academy Award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called &#34;Full Ride&#34; and was in the post-production stages, my interest was piqued. However, that would be the last I would ever hear of that film project. Until last week...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I saw in a TV listing that &#34;Full Ride&#34; was going to be showing on the WB network. This immediately raised a red flag, as I can\&#39;t help but associate WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawson\&#39;s Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride was going to be released straight to TV wasn\&#39;t too flattering in itself. But, nevertheless, I set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher\&#39;s creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two hours passed and the end credits began to roll, I thought long and hard about what I had just seen. What I had just seen was a typical WB-quality show stretched out to the length of two hours. In fact, it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the WB network. Critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical WB show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to begin? The characters are shallow, the story is cliche in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely contrived, and the character development is forced and unbelievable. This movie just screams `unoriginal.\&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character, Matt Sabo, is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid high school football as a fullback, but then fizzles off into a life of crime. He is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously, without much of a choice, he agrees to play football with an all-star football team, but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes the love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a likable character, as opposed to the ever-so-abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first. But, of course, the inevitable comes to pass. She falls for him, changes his attitude towards everything, and all seems good and happy. But now it\&#39;s time for conflict!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in the movie, Amy makes it clear to Matt that she doesn\&#39;t want to score with him, because it would be `shameful\&#39; to her and her mother. This is much to Matt\&#39;s dismay, and his football buddies (yes, they eventually warm up to him) who bet him he wouldn\&#39;t get any. But, of course, Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he\&#39;s not all about the nookie. Here\&#39;s where the exciting plot thickens. If you don\&#39;t want me to ruin this surprise, then skip ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[BEGIN SPOILER]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the All-Star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and make it to the big city. Suddenly realizing he\&#39;s been used and that his love was a sham, Matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before `the big game.\&#39; Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time, but he\&#39;s too hot-headed to buy it. So what will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all-round jerk? I won\&#39;t ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[END SPOILER]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if I somehow got you pumped up for this movie, please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of `Varsity Blues\&#39; or `Summer Catch.\&#39; And that\&#39;s not saying much. There\&#39;s hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about. So what do you have left? Not a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film. It seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow. The characters\&#39; high hopes for making in `the big city\&#39; and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated, and it only further cements the stereotype of Nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. I am unsure of whether or not Hoeger\&#39;s intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he\&#39;s shooting, that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider. If Hoeger actually lived here, you\&#39;d think he\&#39;d know better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am completely disappointed in Hoeger\&#39;s first big film, and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking.&#39;
b&#39;This film is really a big piece of trash trying to make itself look like a Hollywood production.Poor story outline(stupid robot story)...ultra bad acting by untalented pop idols...and they are trying to&#34;FIGHT&#34;!!!My goodness...those miserable actors uses wires to make them look like they are &#34;good fighters&#34;...:(and I hate that arrogant Edison Chen...the worst actor I have ever seen!!!I will never touch his movies again.AVOID this movie at all costs!!!I wanted to give it a negative value out of ten...not even worth a 0/10.&#39;
b&#39;I grew up in the 90s; therefore, you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the greatest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc, These movies constitute my childhood. When these movies came on, not only myself but whoever I was watching them with would stand completely in awe for 1h30, talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend. I don\&#39;t think words could express the amount of excitement Zoog Disney brought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I watch them now, the dialog doesn\&#39;t seem that bad (so effective in fact, that I actually remember parts of conversations literally word per word, from movies I saw over ten years ago). The characters are believable, funny, granted a little stereotypical but that\&#39;s what makes Disney\&#39;s charm... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat my little brother down in front of the Disney channel to try and convey and make him understand my feelings for DCOMs. Enter Stuck in the Suburbs... my brother looked at me slightly puzzled, asking me if I had always been gay. I feel more disappointed and betrayed now than, what could I compare this to?, when Han Solo found out Lando sold him out to Vader... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the movie, and I\&#39;m not exaggerating, is flashbacks. There is no talent in these young actors (some of which are older than I am) whatsoever. The plot is ridiculous; it feels like a bunch of old rotting corporate people over at Disney sat around a table and asked themselves &#34;How can we seem hip to these youngsters?&#34; OK, maybe all the DCOMs were like that, but they at least made a little effort to not let us realize they think we\&#39;re complete idiots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And apparently this type of movie works... Stuck in the Suburbs is rated almost as much as Zenon or Airborne. How is this possible? DCOMs got even cheesier and people prefer them now? (though apparently the lack of curse words is enough to give it 10/10 for some people) Christ, it\&#39;s a completely different generation.&#39;
b&#34;I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s--films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh. So, because of this it&#39;s natural that I&#39;d choose this film--especially because with John Agar in it, it was practically guaranteed to be bad. Sadly, while it was a bad film, it was the worst type of bad film--dull beyond belief and unfunny. At least with stupid and over-the-top bad films, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting. Here, you never really see that much of the monster (mostly due to the darkness of the print) and the acting, while bad, is more low energy bad...listless and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins with some young adults going to Satan&#39;s Hollow to neck. Well, considering the name of the place, it&#39;s not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces! Duh...don&#39;t go necking at Satan&#39;s Hollow!! Well, there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky, so what do the teens go? Yep, throw a dance party--a very, very, very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion. So it&#39;s up to the Sheriff (Agar) and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of mastication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the monster, it&#39;s some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask--a bit like the monster in ROBOT MONSTER. Not exactly original and not exactly high tech. To make it worse, it makes snorting noises and moves very, very slowly--so slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it! How it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, too dull to like--even if you are a fan of lousy cinema.&#34;
b&#34;Not even the Beatles could write songs everyone liked, and although Walter Hill is no mop-top he&#39;s second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies. The nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film, the emergence of the Rapper turned movie star was in full swing, the acting took a back seat to each man&#39;s overpowering regional accent and transparent acting. This was one of the many ice-t movies i saw as a kid and loved, only to watch them later and cringe. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications. I hand it to Walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location. But i fault everyone involved for turning out Lame-o performances. Ice-t and cube must have been red hot at this time, and while I&#39;ve enjoyed both their careers as rappers, in my opinion they fell flat in this movie. It&#39;s about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief. Now this is a movie, its not a documentary so i wont waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie, but there were many, and they led nowhere. I got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was sord of confused and just playing things off the cuff. There are two things i still enjoy about it, one involves a scene with a needle and the other is Sadler&#39;s huge 45 pistol. Bottom line this movie is like domino&#39;s pizza. Yeah ill eat it if I&#39;m hungry and i don&#39;t feel like cooking, But I&#39;m well aware it tastes like crap. 3 stars, meh.&#34;
b&#39;Continuing in the string of &#34;stalker/slasher&#34; flicks in the vein of &#34;Wolf Creek,&#34; &#34;Hostel,&#34; &#34;Joy Ride,&#34; etc., comes &#34;Rest Stop.&#34; The most unoriginal and useless one of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start, reasonably promising, with the violent death of a pretty young girl in a filthy restroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where our interest is lost. We, then, move to the clich\xc3\xa9 road trip couple, on their way to LA with their eyes on acting stardom. . . which, doing movies like this, they\&#39;ll never achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the sexual romp in the park, the couple drives, arguing all the way, to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl to use the bathroom. Harmless enough until she exits and finds her boyfriend missing and realizes she\&#39;s being stalked by a lame version of &#34;Joy Ride&#34;\&#39;s Rusty Nail. . . only driving around in Mater from &#34;Cars&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if this had been directed/written/produced/acted by anyone else, it might\&#39;ve been fairly good. But no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because then comes the ghost story. Yup. . . you guessed it. Plenty of &#34;oh, i\&#39;ll help you, but wait, you\&#39;re dead&#34; to &#34;wait is this stalker a person, monster, or ghost?&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait? Who comes to the rescue to save the girl\&#39;s life and possibly the movie? That one Lawerence brother. Excellent. We\&#39;re saved. (sarcasm) Oh wait, no we\&#39;re not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know. . . if you want to laugh off a pretty bad, or if you get free rentals like I do, give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, you\&#39;ll learn how NOT to make a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-AP3-&#39;
b&#39;Overall I\&#39;d call this a disappointing performance. It attempts the old &#34;Horror Anthology&#34; approach, but fails miserably. The acting was bad, and so were the stories. Any skin shown in the movie was obviously random, just to attract the R-rating for sex. Typical, I guess, but bad nonetheless. Take your $5 and rent a REAL movie instead!&#39;
b&#39;This was a dreadful, boring movie, even for a documentary. At times, it did provided insight to life and also had humorous moments, but overall it was not worth seeing. Every time I began to feel sympathetic towards Mark and began to hope he would be successful, I would become disappointed by his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse.&#39;
b&#39;In need of work, straight man Bud Abbott (as Jack) and comic partner Lou Costello (as Dinkel) get the latter a job babysitting self-described &#34;problem child&#34; David Stollery (as Donald). Young Stollery winds up reading Mr. Costello\&#39;s favorite novel (see if you can guess the title), which puts Costello to sleep, dreaming he and Mr. Abbott are reliving the story of &#34;Jack and the Beanstalk&#34; (you guessed it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sepia-tone switches to color for the bulk of the production. Apparently, this was an attempt at something different for the duo, a colorful children\&#39;s fantasy. It fails, but this is where you get to see Abbott &amp; Costello in color, silent film superstar William Farnum (as the King) make his last performance a bit part, boxer Max Baer\&#39;s brother Buddy, and Stollery before Disney\&#39;s &#34;Spin and Marty&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Jack and the Beanstalk (4/4/52) Jean Yarbrough ~ Lou Costello, Bud Abbott, Buddy Baer, William Farnum&#39;
b&#34;So.. what can I tell you about this movie. If you cheated a lot in high school, you do recognize some cheattips...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best thing i can tell you about this film!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like American-teen movies, maybe you also like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i don&#39;t see this kind of movies as something funny.. sorry to say but if you are older then 10 years, i shouldn&#39;t advise you to watch this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because there is one shot with a couple of beautiful women (girls.. in this movie) i&#39;ll give it a rate of: 2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so.. deal for yourself! good luck&#34;
b&#39;Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war effort from the inside. It\&#39;s pretty hard to figure out at first because, while we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation just isn\&#39;t very clear. I won\&#39;t spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. There are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that doesn\&#39;t know what is going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house. There are comments like, &#34;A true patriot would do this or that.&#34; It\&#39;s obvious while suspicion abounds most of the world wouldn\&#39;t know a spy or a subversive if it jumped up and bit them. I also was surprised to see Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I never realized that he ever did anything other than sit on a horse. There is, of course, the smugness of the criminals as they think that they are immune from the killer\&#39;s guest list. Anyway, Bela is sort of a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one. The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won\&#39;t spoil it. As a curiosity, and a period piece, it may be fun to watch for some people.&#39;
b&#39;I never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused. Especially in French and the neighboring countries (in Belgium, where I am located, for example), &#34;Baise-Moi&#34; was announced as THE most shocking and THE most thought-provoking social drama you could ever experience. Yeah right! It might be a little shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone getting shot up the arse?), but the weak and pointless plot surely didn\&#39;t cause me to think much. &#34;Baise-Moi&#34; is another one of those &#34;blame everything that goes wrong on society&#34;-films and they\&#39;re generally not very convincing. About 99% of the people functions perfectly well in this society so why would you blame this exact same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged nymph-girls? The two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flashes. Nadine just killed her roommate; Manu shot her brother and the two meet in an abandoned train-station, late at night. They decide to travel around France together, leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop. Although we\&#39;re constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring to sit through. Like the girls are indicating themselves all the time, the dialogues are lame and the people they run into (and kill\xc2\x85) are very uninteresting. If people want to make porno movies, that\&#39;s fine by me, but please don\&#39;t pretend that it\&#39;s art-house film-making. If you leave out the swearing and the hip camera-work, all there is to see is (not so) arousing pornography. Cool soundtrack, though!&#39;
b&#39;One of the dumbest movies in the history of cinema. Wait, I take that back-- this movie can\&#39;t be included in any category related to &#34;cinema&#34;; it belongs in categories like &#34;waste&#34;, turds, or similar categories. Ironically, it\&#39;s even _about_ two garbagemen. The movie is &#34;Men At Work&#34;, a lightweight crime comedy starring the Estevez (Sheen) brothers from 1990. Setting aside the asinine and implausible plot line, bad acting, bad dialogue, poorly executed stunts and slapstick, continuity errors, and high rate of no-name actors never to be seen again, all in all it was a pretty bad movie anyway (at its core, I mean). It was the kind of movie that might be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn every line, and in a campy kind of way repeat them back and forth in public with your *wasted* friends, thus securing your status as the biggest dorks in your tenth grade class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, I actually submitted an IMDb trivia entry (along with this bad review) to the movie\&#39;s IMDb web page, if only because I spotted a silly little punk music joke that apparently nobody else spotted yet(about the Butthole Surfer statue). I\&#39;m so conflicted about why I should even *waste* my time submitting what looks like a supportive trivia note, when what I really want to do is blow up Emilio\&#39;s acting career (no, wait, he\&#39;s already done that himself. Thanks, dude!) I\&#39;m so glad I *wasted* only time on this, not real money. For that matter, can I maybe have at least one tenth of their budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better movies with just what they spent blowing up cars, carefully placing bikini-clad bimbos in the background, and beating up useless extras (henchmen) in haz-mat suits. I\&#39;d mention Emilio\&#39;s writing credit, but it would be a stretch to call this screenplay &#34;writing&#34; -- it\&#39;s more like crayon-scrawled cartoon ideas. And Charlie Sheen, if you\&#39;re reading this, I assume M.A.W. must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a coked-up, hooker-loving Hollywood brat who had not grown up yet. (Oops! Sorry, I guess that part of your life isn\&#39;t over yet. Get well soon, you &#34;half a man&#34;. Such a promising talent, so *wasted*\xc2\x85 oh look, there\&#39;s that word again.)&#39;
b&#34;This movie is a complete and utter waste of time, one of the worst films I&#39;ve ever seen. And coming from me, that is definitely saying something. In fact, I wish I could have given it negative stars instead of just rating it as a pathetic one-star awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I rented this movie, I had an open mind. I find the legend of the chupacabra interesting and I have a fondness for cheesy horror flicks. But I draw the line at this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting sucked. The lead male gives one of the worst performances ever, looking and sounding unnatural as he delivers his poorly written lines. The lead female gives a slightly more palatable performance, but that really doesn&#39;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chupacabra... well, considering how low budget this movie must have been, the creature was tolerable. It does, however, look exactly like someone in a mask and body suit. The mask is fairly detailed and might look cool in person, but not so on screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of on screen, you&#39;d think they could have at least used a better camera. It looks like it was shot with a camcorder for crying out loud. Not a very good one, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know what whoever wrote this abomination was thinking. The dialog sucks and just... I can&#39;t describe what I feel about it. At least not without getting in trouble with the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice? Avoid this at all costs. It&#39;s just not worth it. If it comes on TV and you have nothing else to do or watch, then *find* something else to do or watch. Read a book, listen to music, *anything.* Just don&#39;t subject yourself to this. If you do, you cannot say you weren&#39;t warned. And for Lord and Lady&#39;s sake, don&#39;t rent this sucker. It is not worth it, even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents. Trust me, I know.&#34;
b&#34;This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time. It&#39;s dull, ponderous, badly acted, and teeth crawlingly pretentious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold, before realising there wasn&#39;t any. The shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful. These have to be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from Outer Space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous &#39;demons&#39; wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I did like the moggys used as extras, I suppose they are least cheap. Though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been enticed into camera by the careful placement of some tuna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is so dreadful, it should have a public health warning. There was a queue at my local video store when I took it back, of people demanding their money back. I kid you not!&#34;
b&#39;Maybe our standards for Vientam movies have increased since Born on the Fourth Of July, Full Metal Jacket, and Platoon. This movie has a predictable plot, bad writing, bad acting, bad directing, bad special effects, etc. Compared with other Vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable.&#39;
b&#39;This is among one of many USA attempts of remaking a old classic British TV show, that\&#39;s more famous than this one. From what I see none of you haven\&#39;t mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a TV 50\&#39;s-60\&#39;s called &#34;Secret Agent Man&#34; The original Secret Agent Man starred the great Patrick McGoohan (The Prisoner,Braveheart,Ice Station Zebra,The Phantom, etc) a man who was tapped to be the first James Bond, but he turned it down because McGoohan was a very devout man and he considered James Bond\&#39;s bed hopping and violent ways to be against his values.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show was done in black and white, and it\&#39;s a pity for those who haven\&#39;t seen it,you are missing out on a lot. The character Mr. McGoohan played in &#34;Secret Agent Man&#34; was named Drake, and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial TV series called &#34;The Prisoner&#34;. The character he played in &#34;The Prisoner&#34; was that of a agent who\&#39;s identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him. What he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the British Secret Service, and on this island the populace don\&#39;t have names but they are referred to by numbers and Patricks character is assigned a number which is &#34;6&#34; It was argued that his Prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in Secret Agent Man but McGoohan himself disputed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ofourse there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original Secret Agent Man spawned. It was written by Johnny Rivers a famous 50\&#39;s and 60\&#39;s pop musician and from what I read some of you are actually think that the song comes from THIS version of the show. You\&#39;re very wrong about that. It was Johnny\&#39;s and it comes from the original TV series so let me help to set the facts straight. To those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid, well in England, it was actually called &#34;Danger Man&#34; and in the US it was retitled &#34;Secret Agent Man&#34; For such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first aired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted this current show has little to do with the original, no such main character named Drake in this one, and I guess they did their best to make this show their version of &#34;Secret Agent Man&#34;. But it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series.&#39;
b&#34;I am a fan of Ed Harris&#39; work and I really had high expectations about this film. Having so good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do? I really think that Needful Things is the worst movie of Harris&#39; filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake. Anyway, I&#39;ve seen much worse movies in my life but Needful Things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent. The story as an overall seems too unbelievable and fake. I don&#39;t know if that is because of the book, &#39;cause I haven&#39;t read it. But if the script was so bad, I can&#39;t see the reason for filming it. Maybe it was the commercial success of King&#39;s books, or the need for low-quality movies for the VHS era of the 90&#39;s. Whatever the reason was, though, this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved.&#34;
b&#39;This person is a so-called entertainer who has to resort to profanity, vulgarity, and slander to try and make others believe he has talent. I have often seen comics use a little of each with effect but when all you can say is laced with it, it is a sign of a drug affected warped mind. Makes me wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be in a few more years of abuse. Poor man!!! I admit I could not watch all of it - too stupid for words. The amazing part of this is that somebody actually believes he is a philosopher!!! No wonder self respect and decency are dwindling and perversity is rising. Could it be that the UFC might have been a factor in his deadened brain?&#39;
b&#34;The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. I should add here that I&#39;m a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. But sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was extremely thin. The pace of the movie was agonizing. I gave it new chances at every turn (mostly because I didn&#39;t want to feel like I was wasting a Saturday morning in NY), but with every new scene, it dragged longer, delivering characters in which I took no interest, with which I could not connect, for whom I could not empathize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I see negative reviews on IMDb of small independent films like this, I sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal axe to grind (something like. . he used to date the gaffer, she dumped him, and now he&#39;s going to trash everything she ever works on). But here, nope. I know no one who worked on this film. And I wish it would have been great. But the film wasn&#39;t dark (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have claimed). . . those suggest that I connected with the film . . . nope, Henry May Long was just too long, empty, and tedious. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s the Tomas Take on this one.&#34;
b&#39;I got stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (at a military base) to see Superman Returns, was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie playing was &#34;See No Evil&#34;, there was no poster up for it, and just a short description of the movie on the schedule...but my girlfriend and I decided to check it out...As soon as I saw it was produced by WWE I just knew it was gonna be awful. The few people in the theater were laughing most of the time, and it was the first movie that I honestly considered walking out on, and I\&#39;ve seen &#34;The Ringer&#34;...okay, I would have walked out of that one, but I was too busy sleeping. The death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good, but other than that, it was just stupid.&#39;
b&#39;Pete\&#39;s Meteor. I seen this referred to as &#34;authentic&#34; and a &#34;gem.&#34; I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I kinda wished that I didn\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this was noted as being Mike Myers\&#39; first dramatic role. Unfortunately it had to be this movie. The first thing you\&#39;ll notice that Pete\&#39;s Meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot. Or rather, a bunch of little subplots that aren\&#39;t really connected and don\&#39;t go anywhere. Young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother. A meteorite lands in their garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named Hugh. Despite the title of the movie, Mickey is the one who lays claim to the meteor, and the &#34;storyline&#34; actually has little to do with the meteor in any shape or form. From here on out, several other characters and subplots are introduced. But like I said before, they don\&#39;t really go anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things go from cute family movie to dark thriller pretty fast, when Pete (Mike Myers) is introduced and starts to play a role. Micky blames him for the death of his parents, though we\&#39;re never really told what happened or why. Hugh has romance problems because his girlfriend can\&#39;t get past his cosmic fascination. And Pete\&#39;s drug-related past starts to catch up with him and temporarily draws his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast into the mix when shady characters start trying to kill him. This would seem to be the main plot, until you realize it doesn\&#39;t even have a role until halfway through the film, making everything else feel like pointless filler. Hugh\&#39;s girl problems, Mickey\&#39;s bad behavior, the meteor...what on EARTH do they have to do with this? Not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the \&#39;plot\&#39; is disjointed and half of it is pointless. But a good cast of characters can save it, right? Keyword: good. The majority of characters are terribly unlikable people, most of which you\&#39;d like to see die horribly. At least, I know I would. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, which is a really bad move once you see him in action. He is one of the WORST little kids I\&#39;ve seen in a movie, with an extremely bad attitude problem. He \&#39;borrows\&#39; a car, harasses and talks trash to Hugh (an adult) for taking the meteor, actually attempts burn the man\&#39;s house down when he doesn\&#39;t get his way, and even tries to stab Pete with a knife. You\&#39;d think a kid like this is on his way to the jail house. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that Mickey never gets what\&#39;s coming to him. I\&#39;m not sure at what point you\&#39;re supposed to be sympathizing with his character, because he\&#39;s always a nasty little brat. He\&#39;s the ringleader for his brother and sister, so they predictably end up taking and backseat and just following whatever he does. Amazingly, they\&#39;re pushed back so far that I can\&#39;t even remember their names. They might as well not even be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their grandmother is pretty much a borderline alcoholic. She tends to be just as nasty to Hugh as Mickey, and likes to push people out of her house and give them evil glares when she\&#39;s not chugging down liquor bottles and drinking herself silly. Pretty ridiculous when you take into account that she\&#39;s supposed to be taking care of three children. Her issues with alcohol are never really addressed, though she does collapse from time to time in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugh is one of the few likable characters in the movie, but that\&#39;s only because he\&#39;s the punching bag for the majority of characters and takes their mess without giving it back. The kids treat him nastily but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do nice things with them. He\&#39;s got a taxi driver girlfriend who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal offense, attempting to leave him several times in the movie when he goes off into his cosmic lingo or does something to prove that he isn\&#39;t exactly on the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (thankfully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there\&#39;s Mike Myers as Pete. Pete, despite having the only solid purpose and plot in the movie, is extremely underused and doesn\&#39;t play any kind of role until the second half. It\&#39;s unfortunate that Myers got stuck in such a position for a dramatic role. Even when Pete is getting screen time, half of it is just Myers running through dark alleys and hiding in small corners. And even though he was the only real point to this movie, when his plot line brings the movie to a close, it\&#39;s a strange, unfulfilling conclusion that has all the characters laughing on a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of the movie, making you wonder if they were just performing in the movie you were just watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing worth seeing in Pete\&#39;s meteor is Mike Myers\&#39; role as Pete, and that\&#39;s if you can wade through this disjointed mess long enough without lashing out at another human being due to the extremely unlikable characters and nonexistent plot line. No sir, I didn\&#39;t like this one at all.&#39;
b&#34;This film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be so up its own arse and yet it completely not funny. It&#39;s just that there is nothing of interest in this film. There are no real jokes that make you amused, you just watch for 80 minutes, then turn it off. I bought this on very budget DVD and I&#39;m glad because it&#39;s not worth much. This isn&#39;t even one of those films that&#39;s so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk/high and have a good giggle. I didn&#39;t hate it like I hate some films, but it is rather boring, and not worth investing any time in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only people who voted 10 on the votes for this film must have been connected to it somehow because I cannot imagine anyone actually liking this film other than small children passing time&#34;
b&#34;All I can say is, this movie is made for the Lifetime Channel on TV, which means no solid characters, no particular style, weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no-breasts and tushs (because boy, that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze wouldn&#39;t it?) but the heavily simulated sex, well, that&#39;s OK. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When watching these films I have to ask myself, when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers ever grow up? I think these companies are actually way behind the times. They really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change. The whole point of many American TV channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized, diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line. I guess it works for them... or at least it has. Not sure about the future though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t bore yourself to death like I did. Seek out some real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn&#39;t have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show.&#34;
b&#39;...so where\&#39;s my friggin trophy? I seriously expected a banner and confetti to drop from my ceiling for watching a full 30 minutes of that crap. Comedy Central is truly dropping the ball lately, trying to fill the void left by Chappelle with multiple seasons of a retarded man impersonating retarded men. Dah duh nah!! If you pay attention to the show, you\&#39;ll notice that when Mencia isn\&#39;t stuttering over punchlines and laughing at his own skits, he only makes exaggerated observations which seem to lack any sense of humor. You ever notice how people in Buick\&#39;s drive really slow? It\&#39;s like Dah duh nah! Not even the midgets and half naked hot chicks manage to distract from Mencia\&#39;s distinct lack of talent. Furthermore, Mencia isn\&#39;t even a &#34;wetback&#34; as he constantly and adamantly proclaims he is, which makes him a fraud on top of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything good could be said about Mencia, it\&#39;s his effort. The man clearly has no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, god knows he\&#39;s trying.&#39;
b&#39;I have seen three other movies that are worse than this one, &#34;Plan 9 from Outerspace&#34;, &#34;Side Hackers&#34; and the dreaded &#34;Blair Witch Project&#34; There are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isn\&#39;t believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s start with an AMTRAK train with no skirts or handrails between cars. The killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one scene a killer sneaks into a woman\&#39;s apartment. He wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her, so what does he do? He turns up her stereo! If I heard my stereo suddenly get louder I\&#39;d be concerned. He kills the women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub. I was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cord could be tossed ten feet and remain plugged in. Plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boeing 747 is one of the most well known commercial airliners on the planet so this part really amazed me. First the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it wasn\&#39;t on the top deck of the plane. I watched in utter amazement as the pilot and co-pilot (Where was the flight engineer?) walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward toward\&#39;s the nose of the airplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also amazed that bullets wouldn\&#39;t penetrate an aluminum serving cart (good thing for our hero), or bathroom doors, but would penetrate the ceiling causing a fuel leak that exited through a small hole in the fuselage. Huh? Watching three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn\&#39;t check, was this a movie of the week or something? It was terrible.&#39;
b&#34;This was something I had been looking forward to seeing. The Ultimate Avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since Iron Man has been one of my favorite Marvel characters I thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an Iron Man solo title. But the final film was unsatisfying. I wasn&#39;t expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to Iron Man gray armor. The red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together. Not a major complaint but not what I expected from the ads and box. The worse thing however was the story, the acting and the cell-shaded CGI animation for the monsters and Iron Man armor that was not convincing. It didn&#39;t blend in well with the cell animation at all. Even on it&#39;s own it seem stick-like and lifeless. Tony Stark&#39;s character arc, as incredibly slow as it takes, is so forced and unconvincing. I wanted to see this movie because I love Iron Man but after forcing myself through the film I wondered if they couldn&#39;t have come up with something that had been as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies.&#34;
b&#34;This is a classic B type movie that you&#39;d rather not waste your time and see. It started well and i thought it will grow up as a good thriller, but i was mistaking. All movie long you get the feeling that soon something interesting will take place and it will suddenly turn into a tensed thriller, but that doesn&#39;t happen. It runs slowly and peacefully til the end, with nothing interesting in it. Just the ending was unexpected and original, but that&#39;s it. Vote: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why is this movie rated R anyway???&#34;
b&#39;This DVD is barely 30 minutes long, and has dull interviews that reveal that the average Slipknotian has an IQ of around 30. But these aspects are the least problematic here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real trouble is that Slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell over 100,000 units of their crap. (The only reason I say &#34;one of the&#34; instead of &#34;the&#34; is because System Of A Down are even worse.) Much like Ed Gein\&#39;s girlfriends, this band\&#39;s music is pieced together from age-old metal clich\xc3\xa9s, which are to be found in both their image and their ultra-dull music. In fact, their image is kind of fun; their videos are like snippets from cheesy horror films hence they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their music, however, consists of nothing of quality - whatsoever: just a bunch of gimmicky, heard-them-a-million-times-before played-solely-at-the-guitar-neck riffs that are in no way related to each other and yet are randomly grouped together to form &#34;songs&#34; that have no cohesion, no highlights, no nothing. But if the riffs are truly bad, then the vocals are even worse: Slipknot\&#39;s singer has a stereotypical hence uninteresting &#34;evil&#34; growl - the kind 90% of all metal bands today have - but that is nothing compared to when this deluded hick starts trying to sing! Still, what could one expect? Rule no.39 of the &#34;Nu Metal&#34; handbook says quite clearly: &#34;You will alternately growl and sing. Ignore the fact that the two styles don\&#39;t mix well, because most of your fans are so tone-deaf they will love you even if you **** into the microphone.&#34; Slipknot are at their absolute worst when their &#34;singer&#34; starts belching out &#34;melodies&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back to their image. It\&#39;s stolen, copied, ripped off, nicked, borrowed, taken without asking from none other than Mr.Bungle. You\&#39;ve never heard of them? Of course you haven\&#39;t. You only listen to nu-metal, and Mr.Bungle is quite far from that, and beyond any categorization anyway. They too wore masks - grotesque, horror ones, similar to those of Slipknot, I might add - in the late 80s and early 90s. This band, whose frontman is Mike Patton from Faith No More, never hit it big because their music wasn\&#39;t directed toward the average music fans (to put it mildly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, basically Slipknot aren\&#39;t even original in the image department. They have nothing at all new to offer hence will be forgotten in several years: once the masks become boring to the legions of their zit-faced fans, which is when Slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of Mike Patton, it\&#39;s interesting that a number of nu-metal bands often site his singing as a major influence. Predictably - and thankfully - Patton is not flattered by this and has denied being in any way proud to have been an influence for one of the worst metal sub-genres ever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, enjoy this short DVD and the cheap thrills it might provide to the untrained ear and bored eye... And then polish those Slipknot posters, because in a few years no-one will be taking care of them, the poor dears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having seen Corey in the documentary &#34;Get Thrashed&#34;, I finally understand why he wears a mask: he is a blue-eyed baby-faced ginger, looking like Dave Mustaine\&#39;s younger brother! Not exactly scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more of my music-world rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please punish me hard, very HARD, by clicking &#34;no&#34; below.

b&#34;Most of you out there really disliked this movie... you were right. A small minority of you really loved the movie... can&#39;t say you&#39; re wrong. For me, this movie was too stupid. I have seen many dumb, silly comedies but this one surpasses every one of them. As I was watching I couldn&#39;t stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what I was seeing and trying to decide if I should laugh or cry, as *REALLY STUPID* stuff were going on on the screen, and people were leaving the theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the leading characters, time travel is accomplished, just enter any museum and you will actually travel to the past. Plus, if you are seeking an after death experience, just go to the nearest planetarium, there you shall meet Lord - sorry, Loydd and be given important commands... All te above doesn&#39; t really make sense, right? Well, go ahead, watch the movie (I almost never regret the movies I watch), you probably won&#39;t like it, but you will be intrigued by the writer&#39;s ability in producing the ultimately STUPID script...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39; m giving it a 3 out of 10, not good, far from being the worse...&#34;
b&#39;As a devotee of Ms. Frank, I remember being so excited that the play was being re-made for TV. That is, until I saw it... This film is a prime example of how IMPORTANT casting is, and how directing plays such an important part in creating the sense of purpose. The casting of any CENTRAL role is CRUCIAL to a production of this sort...shows like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the charisma of the lead actor. And in the cast of this movie, the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious casting of Melissa Gilbert in the lead role. There is not ONE SINGLE MOMENT that Ms. Gilbert even comes close to inhabiting the sensitive, mature spirit of Anne- Ms. Gilbert is &#34;white-bread&#34; throughout the movie... the only time I was close to tears was during the reading of Anne\&#39;s most haunting line: &#34;I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart&#34;- this is spoken by Ms. Gilbert so rushed, so lacking in conviction, that she might has well burped and achieved the same effect. Film and dance legend Marge Champion was the dialogue coach for this production- she should have refunded her salary! Despite Ms. Gilbert ruining DIARY, other performances are satisfactory for the most part- special kudos to Joan Plowright as Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have the deep-rooted soul and spirit as Otto as does the creator of the role on stage and film(Joseph Schildkraut), but he\&#39;s okay. Doris Roberts and James Coco as The Van Danns are relatively superficial in their parts- they\&#39;re shrill and bombastic, but again, only on the surface. This COULD be due to the fact that the pacing of the project is way too rushed(as noted in previous postings)- this film clocks in 45 minutes shorter than the film version- the difference owing to the pauses for dramatic effect, which apparently is necessary to propagate the appropriate MOOD for the story. This is NOT mandatory viewing, especially for youngsters learning about Anne Frank for the first time- stick to the original film version, and or even better, the TV production of ANNE FRANK: THE TRUE STORY starring Ben Kingsley, which is the CLOSEST thing to capturing the heartbreak and reality of Anne\&#39;s situation ever filmed! Note: Especially appalling is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anne\&#39;s sister Margot, is NOT included in the opening credits along with all the other members of The Secret Annex... she\&#39;s listed in the post-credits along with the actors playing Miep and Mr. Kraler. If I was Ms. Marshall, I would have SUED!&#39;
b&#39;Oh. Good. Grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this movie title in the TV schedules and thought &#34;I must watch this movie, ripping off Snakes On A Plane, it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too. Sounds fantastically bad&#34;. Well, I was half right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is eye-meltingly bad and, sadly, not even unintentionally hilarious. It\&#39;s just bad. Even worse, it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action. For the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language (Mexican or Spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on. Then we have to endure even more terrible acting, and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak English anyway, as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low-budget does not always mean &#34;bad&#34; but, in this case, it does. What we have here is a movie given no thought, a terrible script, a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on it\&#39;s very few strengths. I give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous. Avoid if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See this if you like: Stagknight, The Wicker Man remake, terrible CGI.&#39;
b&#39;**WARNING** MISERABLE MOVIE **WARNING** The day before Christmas eve, some nut case decided he\&#39;d entertain us by sending this movie as &#34;entertainement&#34; on TV. What in Gods name was he thinking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is filled with awful humor, despicable acting, lousy jokes and a disaster of a plot line. Randy Quaid plays the idiotic role as Cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a brain dead person, who\&#39;s incapable of even the simplest tasks. He was fired because he was dumb as a brick, but the company he worked for was sorry for it so they sent him and his family on a vacation. But being as stupid as he is, he managed to make the vacation into a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all it\&#39;s the worst movie I\&#39;ve seen, and I have nightmares still over the miserable acting and the even more miserable jokes in this movie. It\&#39;s so sad you ALMOST have to see it... But don\&#39;t. The nightmares I have are far worse than any other nightmares you will ever have. Trust me... I hate this movie so bad because of it\&#39;s acting, the humor, the &#34;jokes&#34; and the story. The only good thing was the nice scenery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well It\&#39;s my opinion, and I surely hope everyone agrees with me...&#39;
b&#34;probably the worst creature feature ever,boa vs python was a million times better then this &amp; that wasn&#39;t great either,bad acting,bad effects &amp; guess what the DVD is one of those one with 3 hours of previews before the main menu.probably the least scary movie ever,no blood or violence,people are stupid and keep using pistols when they have no affect on these animals, the only cool part was the radioactive leeches that was pretty cool,i name of the island is just a rip off of Jurassic park boring tiring &amp; not worth even looking at but i suppose the characters stupidity is pretty funny so it would make a good comedy film but definitely not a thriller&#34;
b&#39;Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted, disgusting ways. I thought I\&#39;d seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire. Hildy is quite the prankster too: she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut...then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire! &#34;Witchery&#34; made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever-ever-ever made by otherwise competent people...until the finale. I have to admit I loved the ending. It involves a boy and his toy tape-recorder cornered by Linda Blair looking fantastically possessed. The scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie\&#39;s over, but you know that old saying: &#34;If you\&#39;ve got a great ending, people will forgive you for just about anything!&#34;&#39;
b&#34;This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction. I thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs. Well it turns out that this movie really was terrible. The whole plot doesn&#39;t follow on the Pulp Fiction plot. It turns to other movie like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughs came out of this movie, but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me. If you are thinking of renting this movie, please don&#39;t it will waste 90 minutes of your life. Reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense. Please if there is a Plump Fiction 2, I will definitely not go on and rent the sequel. Just giving a heads up for those out there.&#34;
b&#39;Very curious that Nichols and Hanks would team up for this, obviously they believe it. Strange because it should carry the title &#34;Charlie Wilson\&#39;s War the Lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could the time frame leave out the real history that while ridding Afganistan of the Russians the CIA was providing support for the Taliban, and today\&#39;s World of Terrorism. In 1990, Bin Laden went home to Saudi Arabia as a hero of jihad, who along with his Arab legion, &#34;had brought down the mighty superpower&#34; of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid any connection to Osama Bin Laden is to say again, Hollywood cares little for Historical Truth. Charlie Wilson, a patriot, hardly, more like a congressman gone amok.&#39;
b&#34;Hulk Hogan and Zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors. Hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal I&#39;ll never know why. If not for vince Mcmahon&#39;s money this stupid film would have never been made. Maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling. No Holds Barred is not that movie.&#34;
b&#34;Hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade B performance and he delivers a rather good one. Outside of Madsen and Hopper the acting is horrid; you&#39;ve seen better at your local high school. The sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of B-movies. The scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes I&#39;ve ever seen (it doesn&#39;t even come close to fitting in the movie). The script was probably a great 10-page outline, but when it comes out to a full-length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies Madsen left behind. I do have to say Hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the Hummer had me laughing out loud, but I don&#39;t think that was the intent. Yes there is a little style, and Hopper can always draw my interest. However the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this.&#34;
b&#34;If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch weren&#39;t such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is.The story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one,and well worth exploring.However on the negative side,the plot becomes increasingly over the top as the story progresses,and the music choices more and more bizarre,so that by the end I found myself laughing when I know the director intended for me to be crying.&#34;
b&#39;When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker clich\xc3\xa9. With character names like &#34;Pistolero&#34;, &#34;Comanche&#34; and &#34;The Gent&#34; I braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. Dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while &#34;CC Rider&#34; plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawn! The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable. Seeing old men like Bishop and Madsen (in a freaking ruffled shirt) riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men trying desperately to relive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost. Even an appearance by Dennis Hopper in full Easy Rider swing, couldn\&#39;t save it. And let\&#39;s talk about the store bought tans shall we? Many have compared this to Tarantino\&#39;s work. It is not even close. What makes Tarantino\&#39;s work so brilliant is he knows it\&#39;s over the top so he just goes balls out and takes it as far over the top as possible. Bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploitation genre.&#39;

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.</p>
<p><img src="Web App Diagram.svg"></p>
<p>The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.</p>
<p>In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.</p>
<p>Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">Setting up a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.</p>
<h4 id="Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> page and click on <strong>Roles</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>AWS service</strong> is the type of trusted entity selected and choose <strong>Lambda</strong> as the service that will use this role, then click <strong>Next: Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the search box type <code>sagemaker</code> and select the check box next to the <strong>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</strong> policy. Then, click on <strong>Next: Review</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>LambdaSageMakerRole</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">Part B: Create a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on <strong>Create a function</strong>. When you get to the next page, make sure that <strong>Author from scratch</strong> is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>sentiment_analysis_func</code>. Make sure that the <strong>Python 3.6</strong> runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on <strong>Create Function</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below.</p>

<p>Using AWS Console, navigate to <strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> and then click on <strong>Get started</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page, make sure that <strong>New API</strong> is selected and give the new api a name, for example, <code>sentiment_analysis_api</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create API</strong>.</p>
<p>Now we have created an API, however it doesn't currently do anything. What we want it to do is to trigger the Lambda function that we created earlier.</p>

<p>For the integration point, make sure that <strong>Lambda Function</strong> is selected and click on the <strong>Use Lambda Proxy integration</strong>. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.</p>
<p>Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the <strong>Lambda Function</strong> text entry box and then click on <strong>Save</strong>. Click on <strong>OK</strong> in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.</p>
<p>The last step in creating the API Gateway is to select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown and click on <strong>Deploy API</strong>. You will need to create a new Deployment stage and name it anything you like, for example <code>prod</code>.</p>
